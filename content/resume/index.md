<h3> <a href="https://cvent.com/">Cvent</a> - <a href="http://quickmobile.com/">Quickmobile</a>, Mobile Application Developer, Jul 2015 - Present</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>The company still had a need for extra skills maintaining existing client applications and growing the product</p>
<h4>Action</h4>
<p>Initially working cross platform on Windows, iOS and Android, existing applications were maintained.  As the clients moved to the new platform, helped reduce risk by helping sunset legacy platforms and joining a single platform team.  Offered several improvements to the existing Android platform, for example, making better use of fragments and external beacon support with notifications.</p>
<h4>Result</h4>
<p>Legacy platforms successfully sunsetted, new platform quality improved over several support/bug tickets.  Better use of fragments on Android platform allowed less resource usage resulting in no memory crashes and an overall improved UX experience with side-transitions.  With beacon experiences at conferences, the android platform performed reliably with a good user experience. Played a role in a successful aquisition by Cvent, and partipated in learning new technologies like Couchbase and React Native</p>
