Do you remember that game you played when you were young? The one where one person would say something, and it gets passed around until its a completely new story?  Over the holidays, I came up with an idea for a web app that essentially does the same thing but in the context of creating a story.

Basically, you as a user can create a new story and each story has a sequences which are short blurbs that continue from the last sequence.

Sequences can be voted by others (hopefully evolving into an editing process).  They also have a rich text editor that allows for images, video, links, formatting, etc.

On the TODO list:

*   Alternatives - one story becomes another
*   notifications for your owned stories and sequences
*   exporting of a story to electronic book format, pdf, whatever

I dunno, it was a fun project for over the holidays, I wonder if anything will come of it.
