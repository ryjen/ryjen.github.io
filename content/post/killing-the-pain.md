TL;DR

- software engineering culture is like poison
- media life is the primary driver of anything in modern world
- happiness is not listed in any discriminatory policy but it exists

Pain is the only lens from which I can view the software industry.

"Killing" is such a sales word, but its what I want to do to it.

Normally, a level of unsatisfaction would be OK - its just a job.  Hard to accept as a hobby once loved, or as a threatened means of survival.

People tell me I am too negative (which I am).  Easy for them to say. 

More easy to take advantage of happy people isn't it?

Easy to turn on people that get in the way happiness too, isn't it?

Everywhere I turn these days, in my mind I expect to be blocked and disappointed.

It adds a little bit more pain to a very large and growing body of pain.   Like a virus.

There are two planets, one of beings and one of apes, and the apes have it.  And they are hairy.

I imagine monkeys from 2001 space odyssey finding a tool and sensing its power.

I imagine being like them and using a bone(r) to smash the head of every newbie nerd, ignorant superior, every slippery sales person, and every hypnotized capitalist pig wannabe American that ever threatened me.

There is something very satisfying imagining smashing until their head is nothing but a bloody stump that no longer disrespects my survival or love.  It matters not if I am negative or jealous anymore.

All the while with glorious epic music cheering me on.

One cannot work or do much of anything in this state of mind obviously.  

Has been an increasing problem.  When covid cut the thread I was hanging from... 

I knew from the relief I felt, that there would probably be some sort of failed rebound, and an abused career would die.  Just like my relationship and family expectations.

Companies are in need of good people and want to weed out bad ones.  

Happiness and hair are not something listed in any discrimination policy.  But its there.

I hate it when companies try to make work like a family.  There is nothing I like about a dysfunctional family - personal of work.  There is nothing I like about being unhappy because my personal "pedigree" is lacking.

People often think recruiters are used for incoming, but I suspect they could be used for outgoing as well.  "Butter up" a person into thinking they are quite something, and send in a recruiter.

Thus, I do declare, I need some dignity, a career change and some help.

To get away from the happy phonies, the abuse and not be contributing to someones ego, career, partner or family would be like HEAVEN.

Anything else would be poison.
