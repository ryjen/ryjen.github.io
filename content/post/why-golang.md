Have become a fan boy of [golang](https://golang.org) as a replacement for my beloved C purely because it is so simplified, and thus a **guru** language to me.

As it stands now, I am somewhat burned out in the depths of a mid-life crisis and pandemic.  Do not have, or want, the memory capacity for anything more complex or verbose.

A language like go meets these soft skill requirements more than others:

- is not verbose
- implementations from different people are mostly consistent
- sufficient tooling
- efficient with no virtual machine or binary dependency
- cross platform and C-compatible binaries
- used in industry

[Rust](https://rustlang.org) is a very close second only because it is more verbose and you have to master the borrow checker.
[Swift](https://swift.org) suffers from implementation differences and the apple bias, but benefits from optimizations.
[C++](https://cppreference.com) is hell if a person is not pragmatic enough to use wisely and strictly.

The rest of the languages are great in their own right but do not meet my needs.  

A summary of possible modern language paths:

Legacy || Modern
--- | ---
C | Go
C++, Objc | Rust
Objc | Swift
Java | Kotlin, Scala, Clojure
Erlang | Elixir
VB | C#, F#
JS | TypeScript, Babel

A common problem with libraries and frameworks is [overchoice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overchoice).  One does not need overchoice in the fundamental idiosyncrasies of a language.

### frontend

For native mobile you are locked into Swift/ObjC or Java/Kotlin. 

[Cross-mobile frameworks]() are also common but to keep transferable with web, you might as well use a JavaScript one.

[Webassembly]() is becoming a viable option which can use any language.

An finally, [Progressive Web Apps]() are another web option that support native installs on mobile and desktops.

Golang can be used for [PWA development](https://github.com/maxence-charriere/go-app) as well.   To me this is the ideal solution that supports the most platforms simply.
