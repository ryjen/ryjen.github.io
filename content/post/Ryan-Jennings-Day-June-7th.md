Today something interesting started on Facebook: Ryan Jennings Day.  (Only geniuses named Ryan Jennings could conceive of something this awesome - har har)

Besides putting in vacation time, you can join the [facebook group](http://www.facebook.com/events/453998244659027/) if you wish.

As a side note, this site's domain name actually pays homage to the initials "RJ"  (pronounced "Arge" aka "arg3")
