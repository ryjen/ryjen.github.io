## Introduction

Somewhere around 2005, I had the good fortune of doing a research paper on [nanotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology#Tools_and_techniques) for university. I've been very interested in the topic ever since.

If you aren't used to hearing about nano technology the summary is this:  it is **a technology that works are the nano scale** (1 billionth of a metre).  

To put it in perspective, it takes 10 hydrogen atoms side by side to equal 1 nanometre.  A human hair is 80,000 nanometres.

It is about working with and rearranging atoms to create or do just about anything.

## Current Status

- 2018 usage
  * Currently, we are able to use nano-technology to water-proof existing materials using a spray.
  * CMOS transistors in the limits of 18nm.
- government investment
- universities
  * MIT Nano-Lab
- tools

## Going Forward / Speculation

### Material Improvements

A promising nano-structure is called the [carbon nano-tube](https://example.com/carbon-nanotube).  This structure is 10 times the strength of steel and yet super lightweight with conductivity properties.

The implications of carbon nano-tubes are enormous. For example, safer space ships, disaster proof buildings, body armor, space suits, etc.

#### Smart Materials

If we combine electronical or computational properties of nanotechnology with materials we get "smart" materials.  These will make apple watches and google goggles look like typewriters to computers.

`TODO: reference, expand, recent smart material conference, south korea`

### Electronical

An interesting aspect of nano-technology is the electronical properties or [nanoelectronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoelectronics).  The conductivity of atoms or molecules is very different from traditional transistors and much more energy efficient and faster.

#### Computational

Improved nano-electronics has enormous implications for computer design and memory storage. 

CMOS and CPU units of computers can all be assembled as molecular structures.  Electric current is transmitted through nanowires or nanotubes.   Parts could have "self assembling" properties using molecular attraction. This will replace traditional photolithography manufacturing techniques. Nano computers also avoid other traditional problems like overheating and defects.

Memory storage can also be refactored with nano-electronics. Most advancements work by harnessing the [attraction of atoms or molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Waals_forces) to achieve a "state" which can be saved and read.  This molecular state is permanent.

![conceptual memory system](http://nano.memory/example)


In advanced forms, quantum computing would be a reality. In the quantum world, a particle can have 3 states: **present**, **not present** and **unobserved**.  This replaces the binary system of traditional computers and creates enormous computing power at a fundamental level.
Quantum computing will definately allow advanced artifical intelligence.  

Wireless networking will also be reimagined with nano-electronics.

#### Energy

If nanotech brings a way to more efficiently store energy as well, an improvement to the long stagnent battery technology would be very beneficial.

`TODO: give more examples, research computing and batteries more`

### Engineering

#### Nano-Machines

One of the more striking aspects of nanotechnology is the ability to produce mechanical parts out of atoms.  First step is basic things like gears or switches.

![a nano machine](https://some.example.com/img.png)

#### Nano-Factories

As a matter of nano building blocks getting more and more advanced, we can imagine systems like nano-factories that can produce more sophisticated objects using these building blocks.  A good analagy is the replicator from star-trek.

Currently, the "replicator" is in progress at the MIT Nano-Lab.  It is still largely inefficient and expensive, but this will only improve.

![a nano factory](https://some.example.com/factory.png)

There is also no reason "replicators" cannot replicate themselves if needed, providing access to almost everyone.

A complex nano-factory or other nano-machine will need "nano-software" as well to describe how to operate.  Given new storage and computational capabilities, entirely feasible and the amount of information available would be vast.

#### Nano-Bots

Nano-robots or nano-bots are nano-machines embedded with computational smarts.  Where as a nano-factory would need instructions, nano-bots would be autonomous and perform tasks.

`TODO: research work at MIT on nano-factory`

### Health Benefits

Currently we are also experimenting with gene manipulation as well in an attempt to avoid problems or for pure vanity.  Nanotech will be sure to advance progress in this area.

#### Diagnostics

Building nano-structures whose molecular structure is designed to attach to target areas in the human body and have the ability to be identified by physicians. 

#### Treatment
A more advanced step in health and nanotech is for a nano-bot to be able to modify cells in the human body.

A use case would be nano-bots and can "seek and destroy" cancer cells.  Once injected in the body, they remain, performing their task.

This could be reproduced for other diseases and even aging or tissue repair.

## Doomsday Scenarios

#### A-Mortality

A-mortal human bodies are prolonged almost indefinately, short of massive trauma, with the aid of nano-bots.

An obvious negative consequence of a-mortal humans is the world population.  It will be a problem if people rarely die and space on earth is limited.  

One solution is limiting procreation but this also leads to having social structures develop that allow only a-mortality for those who can afford it.

We could be forced to recolonize another planet.  Recolonization has its own host of problems like terraforming and running into the same problem again.

#### Health Risks

There is also very little knowledge and what happens to the human body when exposed to engineered molecules at the atomic level.  

It would be a disaster to have a integrated technology that turns out later to have negative health consequences that we cannot control.

There is also the ethical questions raised by modifying humans that could potentially further split social and cultural structures.

#### Nano-bots

Nano-bots also offer an incredible doomsday scenario called [grey-goo](https://grey.goo).  This hypothosis proposes that nano-bots could be made to reproduce itself by consuming matter for raw materials. The self-replicating consumer bots would eventuals consume the entire planet into a cloud of nano-bots (grey-goo).  This scenario is eerily similar to a-mortal humans consuming the planet.

#### Division

Another possibility is that nano-technology is limited and controlled.  Maybe at first with good intentions, but ultimately creates a division of people with nano access and people without.  Either through economic, cultural, or planetary means. 

Given the history of divided humans, its not hard to guess that what follows is war. And we can no longer afford war with this technology.

## The Human Problem

These doomsdays scenarios all have more or less one thing in common at its root.  The human mind.  Specifically, the human ego and lack of conciousness towards others, or relative ignorance of affects.

Nano technology is exponential to the atomic bomb in destructive power as much as creative power.  There is almost no way humanity, given its past and current condition, could survive this technology without a massive, collective shift in thinking.

I'll briefly go over some of things that sabatoge humanity (ourselves).

#### Ego / Individualism

The individual ego is a human mind that "identifies" with a thought form or a phsyical form.
Often creating suffering for itself and others when this "false self" is threatened or lacking.

The "real self" is actually just the awareness of conciousness beyond identification in the world of form.

Current western liberalism relies on the power of the individual.  The power of the individual can only be justified by a collective ego.

#### Collective Ego / Mythology

When the individual egoic mind operates with others, it becomes a collective ego.  This strengthens the "false self" giving it power, purpose and meaning.

Collective ego's create a "mythology" which allows large groups to work together.  This can be appear to be a positive occurance to the ego but often contains negative consequences.

Some examples are sexual orientations, culturism, racism, political parties, organizations, countries and religions.

If you look at the 20th century alone, the massive amount of killing, wars and suffering, is all driven by ego.  If you diagnosed humanity in a clinical sense, you would come to the conclusion that it is a pathological psychopath.

#### Status Quo / Structural

Another problem to shifting technology or human thinking is the structures that already define how we live.  This is often tied to economical reasons.

For example, we definately have the technology to use alternative sources of power for mobility.  Because of all the infrastructure in place for existing technologies, its not economically feasible to change.

If an emerging nano technology provided environmental benefit to the world, it might also be limited in use for the same reasons.

## The Economic Problem

The economic system is complex, but in modern terms largley based on credit.  Credit is based upon trust in a future outcome.  Typically in capitalist terms the trust is an expectation to produce more economic benefit.

This expectation conflicts and overpowers with the priorities of science and ethics. The modern economic growth trend has been spurred on almost unnaturally mainly due to scientific progress every so often.

We're already seeing technologies like the [blockchain](https://blockchain.info) disrupt current economical systems.

It has been shown that producing things with nano-tech will be much cheaper because it is so much more energy efficient.

`TODO: references, compare economic impacts of other tech like printing press, steam engine, computers`

#### Keeping the current economy

One can postulate that early nanotech will likely continue the growth pattern of the economy.

Advancing nanotech looks to be very advantageous for the future and thus more trust credit and economic growth.  And in turn, the technology is funded more for low hanging fruit.

Another possibility is the doomsday scenarios of nano tech bring a distrust of the future. The economy becomes fearful and shrinks, thus abandoning funding for advancement. Or worse funding advancement only for military purposes.

These are glass half-full or half-empty scenarios.  A reality is that both will likely happen.  To me the current economy with nanotech is a risk factor for creating doomsday scenarios.  A tipping point for change must occur as the technology advances.

#### A resource based economy

Given the importance of raw materials needed for more advanced nano tech, would humans place value more on natural resources like previous generations did with copper, silver and gold?

Given that natural resources are abundant, but still limited, could they be tallied and distributed evenly and fairly with quality of life for everyone without destroying the planet?

Would we need to expand to other worlds?

(TODO: reference the "Venus Project" and the resource based economy)

#### Surpassing the need for an economy

Emerging nanotech has potential to have a [post-scarcity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-scarcity_economy) economy.  This essentially means that technology is so advanced and available that goods can be available freely. 

Not having an economy is a radical change that makes many people uncomfortable. Certainly it may not be feasible in the immediate future, but could a century from now or sooner.  Especially with the advancement of the "replicator".

Another point is that if/when quantum computers become feasible, this makes our entire digital encryption system obsolete.  This would effectively force the obsoletion of the economy but is likely quantum encryption of some sort would replace it. 

## Singularity

It has also been conceived that if artificial intelligence evolves, say with the computational enhancements of nanotech, that a runaway technological growth will ensue, resulting in even more unfathomable changes to human civilization.

This is called [technological singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity).

`TODO: expand`

## Conclusion

Even if we do not destroy ourselves, the quality of life would be so improved for all there would be hardly any need for work, and economy or even death.  In such a scenario, what would individual humans do with themselves?  Would they have a purpose?  Would they become more evil, more good?

As you can see, to me its not the technology that has to evolve.  That is inevitable.  Its the human mind and how we relate to each other and our environment.

I will be attending a conference on the issue of the need for humans to evolve, and will continue reading on the subject.  Hopefully I will find hope and report back findings.
