## Introduction

Somewhere around 2005, I had the good fortune of doing a research paper on nanotechnology for university.

If you aren't used to hearing about nano technology the summary is this:  it is **a technology that works are the nano scale** (1 billionth of a metre).  

To put it in perspective, it takes 10 hydrogen atoms side by side to equal 1 nanometre.  A human hair is 80,000 nanometres.

It is about working with and rearranging atoms to create just about anything.

This topic really opened my eyes to the massive changes this will we have when the tools to do so more efficiently are available.


## Current Status

- 2018 usage and progress (TODO: research)
- government investment (TODO: research)
- universities (MIT nano-lab) (TODO: research)

## Future Possibilities

### Nano-Machines, Nano-Factories, Nano-Bots

One of the more striking aspects of nanotechnology is the ability to produce mechanical parts out of atoms.  Things like gears or switches.

Then its only a matter of building blocks.  When the building blocks get larger and larger, we can imagine nano-factories that can produce more sophisticated objects using these building blocks.  A good analagy is the replicator from star-trek.

Another aspect of these nano mechanical parts is nano-robots or nano-bots.  Conceptually, autonomous nano-objects that perform tasks.  


### Health Benefits

A very good use case for a nano-bot is one whose molecular structure is design to attach to cancer cells and destroy them can float around in a human body.

There is also the possibility of other helpful bots that can reducing aging or other diseases.

### Doomsday Scenarios

An obvious negative consequence of a-moral humans is the world population.  What happens when people rarely die?  Do we limit procreation?  Do we recolonize another planet?  Will the social structures of the human ego split into a-mortality only for those who can afford it?

Nano-bots also offer an incredible doomsday scenario called [grey-goo](https://grey.goo).  This hypothosis proposes that a nano-bot could be made to basically consume raw materials to reproduce itself. The self-replicating consumer bots would eventuals consume the entire planet into a cloud of nano-bots (grey-goo).  This scenario is eerily similar to a-mortal humans consuming the planet.

### Material Improvements

A smaller step in nano-technology is to improve the materials we use. 

Currently, we are able to use nano-technology to provide water-proofing on existing materials using a spray. (TODO: add reference, and more current material tech)

Long term, a promising nano-structure found is called the [carbon nano-tube](https://example.com/carbon-nanotube).  This structure is 10 times the strength of steel and yet super lightweight with conductivity properties.

When it becomes more efficient to produce this material the implications are enormous. For example, new space ships, disaster proof buildings, body armor, space suits, etc (TODO: expand more)

### Electronical

Another interesting aspect of nano-technology is the electronical properties.  (TODO: research)

Examples:
  - quantum computers
    * hopefully new forms of encryption or better yet, no need for encryption
  - new memory storage capabilities

## The Human Problem

- the power of the technology is exponential to the atomic bomb
- humanity has not evolved beyond the ego
  * unconcious, fearful, egoic behaviour will ultimately destroy ourselves and/or the planet
- humans must evolve beyond the flawed human mind and its concepts of a false self, borders, inequality, rightousness, fear, selfishness
- "less human, more being"

### Ego / Individualism

### Collective Ego / Mythology

### Status Quo / Structural

### Limited Resources

### Human Rights / Religion


## Conclusion

- the technology is likely to evolve, it is not clear whether humans will and are faced with a touch choice : continue as is and destroy ourselves and the planet, or become concious of our ego and flaws in the hopes of recognizing others as ourselves.
- attending a conference on the issue of the need for humans to evolve first 
- will report back findings
