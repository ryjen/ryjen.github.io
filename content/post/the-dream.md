>  Life is a like a dream, a background awareness of reality.â€¦. as a nightmare at worst and a delusion at best.  You can guide your self down the stream, but you do not know where you are going and you cannot go back.

Caught somewhere in between the *trickle of survival*, *getting ahead*, *a social life*, and *a personal life* - the dream of solid ground seems a myth.  The energy spent on all, too little for any.

So one must analyze the possible dreams available right?  Have you ever tried taking a hard look at some of the most common dreams of people's lives?


## Examples: 

> It is about sex, family, children. 

This is great.  Has a biological directive to obey.

It justifies almost every need in a positive light.

The sense of belonging is joy, the loss of a source of tremendous pain.

And thus the competition to obtain and the protection of, can be as deadly as war.  

Saving the environment from our species makes no sense.


> It is about the mind and science.

This is great.  It explains almost everything and who we are as well.

It justifies almost anything as long as it can be proven.

The competition of is even more frustrating and diabolical than a physical competition and we pursue with typical recklessness and sacrifice.

Yet we still find it difficult to know what a thought is, and if it is who we are.

And thus it is questionable if we have evolved to wield world destructive power like atomic and internet (and now quantum, nanotech, and AI)


> It is about money.

This is great.  At least it is scalable for populating.

It can justify almost any wrong as reality.  Which is ironic given that it is ultimately fictional.

Inequality just means your not trying hard enough.  Try joining a brothel like linked in for help.

The convenience of an abundance of unhealthy crap, makes up for the inhumanity of taking advantage of and reducing each other to a means to an end.

The environmental disasters and the mass vehicle jungle with its effects are only necessary.

> It is about religion

This is great.  A true positive solution.

Our souls will become closer to God and thus the world will become a better place.

It breaks down when we again fail to account for the ego.

Creating religious identities to defend and attack.

And reducing others to good and bad, in vanity like good looking and bad looking.

## Conclusion

I do not like green eggs and ham, nor pipe dreams and scams.

I do not like busting my balls or wasting my time, for someone to achieve their dream.

My frustration I have to let go, and go on with the flow.

For my dreams have changed in awakening to their loss, as mere obstacles down the stream.

Happy Hallow Weenie.
