>  Life is a like a dream, a background awareness of reality.â€¦. as a nightmare at worst and a delusion at best.  You can guide your self down the stream, but you do not know where you are going and you cannot go back.

Caught somewhere in between the *trickle of survival*, *getting ahead*, *a social life*, and *a personal life* - the dream of **solid ground seems a myth**.  The energy spent on all, too little for any.


## Question

Have you ever wondered what dream humanity is trying to achieve?  Or why?

### It is about sex, family, children. 

- has a biological directive to obey.
- justifies almost every need in a positive light.
- the competition to obtain remains a challenge with growth.
- the protection of, can be as deadly as war.
- the individual roles are disconnected.
- species is disastrous for the earth and other species.
- creates a kind of chemical bubble of happiness or grief over loss.

### It is about the mind and science.

- explains almost everything and who we are as well.
- justifies almost anything as long as it can be proven.
- competition is even more frustrating and diabolical than physical.
- pursued with recklessness and sacrifice.
- still difficult to know what a thought is, and if it is who we are.
- questionable if we have evolved to wield world destructive power like atomic and internet (and now quantum, nanotech, and AI).

### It is about money.

- scalable for populating over physical trade.
- justifies almost any wrong as reality, given that it is ultimately fictional, ironically.
- relationships reduced to a means to an end.
- creates inequality (meaning your not trying hard enough, join a brothel like linked in for help).
- convenience of an abundance of unhealthy crap and a vehicular jungle.
- environmental disasters and resource consumption loss greater than without.

### It is about religion

- a positive purpose.
- our souls will become closer to God and thus the world will become a better place.
- breaks down when we again fail to account for the ego.
- creates religious identities to defend and attack.
- reducing others to good and bad, in vanity like good looking and bad looking.

## Conclusion

I do not like green eggs and ham, nor pipe dreams and scams.

I do not like busting my balls or wasting my time, for someone to achieve their dream.

I do not like the collective dysfunction that enjoys suffering and making others suffer.

I do not like wanting candy I cannot have, in a candy store I do not belong in.

I do not like being judged in ignorance or vice versa.

My frustration I have to let go, and go on with the flow.

For the background consciousness of the dream is the only thing that is real.

Happy Hallow Weenie.
