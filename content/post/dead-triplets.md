This post could about music theory and rhythm, such as the triplet guitar riffs in [invincible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxsld16TjSU) or even the lyrics from the whole chart busting album.

But this about a single chapter, in a single from a book from the swamp from which I quote liberally.  It is probably already a more influential book than I realize.

As monks say, the soul is wet (thus presumably messy) and a dry soul is lacking life. 

## entroducing...

Our society emphasizes the external{{<rawhtml>}}<sub><a href="#external-society">[1]</a></sub>{{</rawhtml>}}

And the dead triplets of **depression**, **[desuetude](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/desuetude)** and **despair**

Sit on the tree outside our window,

Waiting for us to falter and become theirs. {{<rawhtml>}}<sub><a href="#crows">[2]</a></sub>{{</rawhtml>}}

## the depression triplet 

It is a 3 headed beast,

One head is reactive to the world of form,

Another head originates from our internal body{{<rawhtml>}}<sub><a href="#internal-body">[3]</a></sub>{{</rawhtml>}},

And another head originates from your mind.

The entire beast may breed and pass its self on

If your conflict with it is strong.

### defeating the depression triplet

To defeat this 3 headed monster, you must use your axe

Cutting the heads off into the past, future and present.

Then you can say you are not your external,

You are not your mind, and you can choose what to feel in the present.

To face, value or respect the depression beast takes great courage

And to not distract ourselves away from its misery.

## the desuetude triplet

Energy lost from the depression triplet still exists,

and creates the desuetude triplet.

The desuetude triplet is an unseen ghost like spirit,

that that unknowingly removes energy from us

because it does not approve of how our ego is investing it.

The spirit will bring a progressive withdraw of enthusiasm or desire.

### defeating the ghost

To defeat the spirit, you must recognize the lost energy

in service to something that is not your true nature.

At its peak of energy drain you are

obliged by a conditioned reward

to putting energy into a soulless task

and feeling shame if you are not productive.


## the despair triplet

When the spirit of desuetude has drained all the energy it can... the third triplet is created.

The despair triplet is a shadow beast with giant consuming jaws.

It makes the soul want to end the agony of ambiguity

by fleeing into its jaws, becoming it,

preferring the "horror known, over the horror imagined".

When the despair triplet consumes you

it manifests either as tragedy, an active suffering

or its opposite, a pathetic victimage, a passive suffering.

### defeating the shadow beast

To defeat the despair beast, one must not deny the suffering

while retaining the modest dignity of humanity

and suffer through toward whatever awaits

beyond the dead triplets{{<rawhtml>}}<sub><a href="#shadow-poop">[4]</a></sub>{{</rawhtml>}}.


## other triplet non-cents

The winged harpies of **stigma** are a constant barrage

of fatigued, angry and insincere guilt

while exploring the swamp.

They live above the swamp and are not of it

but neither are they of this world.

---

The solitude and angst from an absent family,

and ultimately, the lost society that created them,

One may be forced to make friends with the dead triplets.

Attempting a rite of passage,

that does not involve betraying,

their true consciousness.

---

The distorted reality of an addictive search for unmitigated happiness,

one who finds the truth in surviving the dead triplets,

is conflicted with an opportunity for a richer life,

and the reality of how estranged

one still is in the world of form.

---

Success can be experienced as a trap,

when the soul longs to explore or create,

and will likely run directly into

angst defended by guilt

with a difficult choice:

anxiety or depression.

---

As sleep serves healing of the body, or a pain flags a wound

Jungians see depression as a balance and healing of the psyche or a signal of something profoundly wrong.

And the use of imagination or art to activate

unconscious repressed material into consciousness.
