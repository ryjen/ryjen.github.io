This post could about music theory and rhythm, such as the triplet guitar riffs in [invincible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxsld16TjSU)...

But this about a single chapter, in a single [book from the swamp](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/0919123740/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_OgrvFbQY1J529).  It is probably already a more influential book than I realize, from which I quote liberally and implicitly.

As monks say, the soul is wet (thus presumably messy) and a dry soul is lacking life. 

## [entroducing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGQjrBuW-Xg&list=OLAK5uy_lA4P3neYe5g7f9Vs7VD0oCYHcEPytjupI)...

Our society emphasizes the external{{<rawhtml>}}<sub><a href="#external-society">[1]</a></sub>{{</rawhtml>}}

And the dead triplets of **depression**, **[desuetude](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/desuetude)** and **despair**

Lurking in the shadows{{<rawhtml>}}<sub><a href="#shadow-self">[2]</a></sub>{{</rawhtml>}},

Waiting for us to falter and become theirs.

## the depression triplet 

It is a 3 headed beast,

One head is **reactive to the world of form**,

Another head originates **from our internal body**{{<rawhtml>}}<sub><a href="#internal-body">[3]</a></sub>{{</rawhtml>}},

And another head **originates from your mind**.

The entire beast may breed and pass its self on

if your conflict with it is strong.

### defeating the depression triplet

To defeat this 3 headed monster you must use your axe.

By cutting the heads off into the **past**, **future** and **present**

you can then say **you are not your past**, **you are not your mind**, 

and in the **power of the present** moment, you can **choose** how you feel.

To face, value or respect the depression beast

and to not distract ourselves away from its misery

takes great courage.

## the desuetude triplet

Energy lost from the depression triplet still exists,

and creates the desuetude triplet.

The desuetude triplet is an unseen ghost like spirit,

that that unknowingly **removes energy** from us

because it **does not approve of how our ego is investing** it.

The spirit will bring a **progressive withdraw of enthusiasm or desire**.

### defeating the ghost

To defeat the spirit, you must **recognize the lost energy**

in service to something that is **not your true nature**.

Then you may be able to **choose** differently or **accept what already is**.

At its peak of energy drain you are

**obliged** by a **conditioned reward**

to putting energy into a soulless task

and feeling **shame** if you are not productive.


## the despair triplet

When the spirit of desuetude has drained enough energy... the third triplet is created.

The despair triplet is a shadow beast with giant consuming jaws.

It makes the soul want to **end the agony of ambiguity**

by fleeing into its jaws, becoming it,

preferring **the horror known, over the horror imagined**.

When the despair triplet consumes you

it manifests either as **tragedy**, an **active suffering**

or its opposite, a **pathetic victimage** and a **passive suffering**.

### defeating the shadow beast

To defeat the despair beast, one **must not deny the suffering**

while retaining the **modest dignity of parts of humanity**

and suffer through toward whatever awaits

beyond the dead triplets{{<rawhtml>}}<sub><a href="#shadow-poop">[4]</a></sub>{{</rawhtml>}}.


## other triplet non-cents

The winged harpies of **stigma** are a constant barrage

of fatigued, angry and insincere guilt

while exploring the swamp.

They live above the swamp and are not of it

but neither are they of this world.

---

The solitude and angst from an absent family,

and ultimately, the lost society that created them,

One may be forced to make friends with the dead triplets.

Attempting a rite of passage,

that does not involve betraying,

one's true consciousness.

---

In the distorted reality of an addictive search for unmitigated happiness,

one who finds the truth in surviving the dead triplets

is conflicted between an opportunity for a richer life,

and the reality of how estranged

they still are in the world of form.

---

Success can be experienced as a trap,

when the soul longs to explore or create,

and will likely run directly into

angst defended by guilt

with a difficult choice:

anxiety or depression.

---

As sleep serves healing of the body, or a pain flags a wound

Jungians see depression as a balance and healing of the psyche or a signal of something profoundly wrong.

The use of imagination or art to activate

unconscious repressed material into consciousness

helps the psyche heal and move on.
