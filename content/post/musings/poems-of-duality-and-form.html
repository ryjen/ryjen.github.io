     <h2>Love Poem</h2>

     Love is at the mercy of form,<br>

Without, may as not be real.<br>

Form is merciless,<br>

At its peak and as it degrades.

<hr>

Love is a chemical delusion,<br>

That is dependent on others,<br>

To keep the chemicals flowing.

<hr>

Love is loyalty and trust,<br>

Devotion and passion.<br>

Skewed by lack,<br>

And absenteeism in,<br>

A complex world.

<hr>

Love is a great tree,<br>

Of family and positivity,<br>

That casts a great shadow,<br>

Of solitude and negativity.

<hr>

Love will make you believe,<br>

You can overcome anything,<br>

With no regard to consequences.

<hr>

Love is persistent,<br>

As an unfulfilled need,<br>

For connection,<br>

Or a determined suffering,<br>

To unsuccessfully fill the need.

<hr>

Love is manifested,<br>

As a child form,<br>

Used to give meaning,<br>

Justification, and hope.

<hr>

Love is a mother,<br>

Feeding and nurturing,<br>

Dependent and confined.

<hr>

Love is a clan,<br>

Beating all odds,<br>

Until you grow out,<br>

With interfering needs.

<hr>

Love is dead,<br>

And with it the insanity,<br>

Like god was declared as such,<br>

In 1882 by a madman.

<hr>

Love is greater than,<br>

The singular,<br>

Universally and unconditionally,<br>

Free as part of the same,<br>

Not some thing you can understand.

   <h2>Hate Poem</h2>

I hate the vastness,<br>

Of the horribly horrific machine,<br>

And its cold cruelty,<br>

Toward the soul.

<hr>
 
I hate their popularity,<br>

And their opinions,<br>

I hate their identities,<br>

And their actions.

<hr>

I hate how they steal,<br>

And push with a smile,<br>

And act like it is deserved.

<hr>

I hate that there is no respite,<br>

When you are down, or wounded,<br>

In an advanced society,<br>

That does more wounding than growing.

<hr>

I hate they believe,<br>

That there is help for us,<br>

When it is only good at,<br>

Helping them.

<hr>

I hate how they pretend,<br>

Things I say matter,<br>

When they do not.

<hr>

I hate the temporary nature,<br>

Of the conscious self,<br>

And the seemingly irrelevant nature,<br>

Of the unconscious self.

<hr>

I hate playing the game,<br>

Receiving rejection and problems,<br>

Without acceptance or meaning,<br>

And their demand of separateness.

<hr>

I hate their filtered perception,<br>

And irrational value system,<br>

Of escapism through black,<br>

And white ideals.

<hr>

I hate how I need a friend,<br>

When all they do,<br>

Is bloody Caesar like family,<br>

With a stab in the back.

<hr>

I hate how they feel the need,<br>

To protect others from my dilemma,<br>

Until the proverbial but false,<br>

Closet is opened for god.

<hr>

I hate you,<br>

And you hate me,<br>

Ain't it fun,<br>

Like a big purple people eating dinosaur.

<p>
Take it for what you want. Perhaps my meaning is to express it in art form.
