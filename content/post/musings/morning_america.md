Winners and Losers.  All of us have probably felt this is true in some level.

Its true with men, and the various games in the lives of the different hues of man.

Have not read Trumpian literature on the subject but do have my own opinion that is somewhat biased to the loser side.

Starting with the most noisy:

## Winners

In the winner realm there are other dualities that signify their deserving of winning.

Good and evil - winners are good, and people trying to take winning from them are evil.

Winners bring the light to the loser darkness.

In a human being, winners are the human.

The winner weapon of choice in the duality wars is positivity. 

Positivity masks reality and their own natural human condition.

Winners dump negativity in the loser realm if they cannot vanquish it.

They are incapable of recognizing their own suffering as not external, through the positivity mask (or chemicals).

## Losers

In the loser realm the winners represent an extremist form of suffering.

In a human being, losers are the being (not taking a hue of man).

The attachment to positivity in the mother complex can delay enlightenment from the winner realm.  Sometimes for an entire lifetime.

An unenlightened loser has other dualities to signify their victim hood. Such as unconscious vs conscious, suffering vs enlightenment, oppression vs liberation.

A semi-enlightened loser knows that the belief of light in the winner realm creates shadow - but is still more comfortable inside it.

An enlightened loser knows that there is ultimately no winner loser duality, but are forced to participate.

## Insights

The next-gen of America in the power transfer will be to a loser a next-gen of things to miss out on.

America is black and has soul. We will be missing out on that to which they are happy to export, which is fine, except for one thing.

I walk amongst the winning zombies in loserville, all selling me something I am missing out on.  Selling me America.  Selling me false hope, or hope with a loss, hope on something to miss out on.

I see the drug overdoses and the poverty and I look at the history of heroin.  How the British capitalized on China with heroin and think "Yah, If I was asian or south asian, I would want heroin revenge for the British Columbia"

I look at the pandemic struggles and how the winners suffer and how the losers enjoy it and my socialist tendencies think "Yah, that is correct."

I look at social lives of others and see that everyone is trying extremely hard to be a winner to get revenge.  Or being so distraught by people who's circumstances are just right to fit the cookie-cutter.  Or following a pattern that makes them as stupid as possible and giving up as much data as possible.

I look at the winners seeping into the internet and the tech bubble in my lifetime and think "well, that was a waste".

My old victimage says to me, Canada is a loser, America is a winner, and nobody is waking up from it.

At the end of the day, we are just the 'Mericas and I have no idea who Mexico is or why countries still exist in a inter-connected planet that is dying from such collective competition.
