Do you feel entitled to be a victim of someone or something else?

Do you think your mind or the situation generates more suffering?

That you deserve better?  That you are overlooked?

That your perception of reality is absolute?

That you might physically die if you are not what you believe?

Do people take advantage of your suffering?  Or challenge it?

Is your suffering physical, mental or both?

Do you think there is a "mind behind the mind" that sees with pureness (awareness)?

Do you think prayers make you live in the future?

Do you think projecting what want will make it happen? Or create an egoic identity?

Do you think that your ego is "the secret" sauce in your capitalization of dysfunction?

Do you believe "why not is my ego me"?  Somehow I exist this way, there must be a reason or divine purpose?

Do you believe if the ego was to survive the harshness of early civilization, then it is still applicable to human evolution?

Do you think the evolution of humans will happen peacefully and without inequality, while the human ego operates unconsciously with greater technology?

Do you think you are transparent if you hide behind facts?

Do you think that you are clever if you lie?  Even little "white" ones for the greater good?

Do you believe that you can read the same book for a lifetime and still never really get the simple message?

Would you want a new religion if a ruler crucified runaway slaves for every mile across the country?

Would you adopt a "one consciousness" or "tao" to spite your ruler's many gods?

Would you shroud your truth in stories, misperceptions and misinterpretations to survive?

Would you embrace an enlightened individual to awaken you?

Whatever, I am just in line for the music!
