Am very glad a covid vaccine has a real chance.

"Little bottle of hope" for saving humans and creating prosperity for more.

That being said, I am actually very bitter going back to the new-normal, with a lot of skepticism.

## Seed of the Lemon

The root of my problem is that the new-normal is just the old-abnormal and that *pre-covid life was not that great anyway*.

We were always already living on the edge of collapse: environmental, economic, war, societal, or technological.

It could be that is just feels that way as the human condition manifesting.  

Or perhaps it is because external life is like a series of repressed moments to money, time, social embarrassment and pain.  

Will life go back to normal?  Not in my opinion, because human life was never normal.  It is completely out of sync with the nature.

The only thing normal will be: *moving on to the next self-made, human-made, mind-made problem*.

## Other potential problems

### Technological 

Does the fact the vaccine uses *nano-tech* bother anyone?  

How is its use justified without a pandemic?

What if it creates a super-super bug?

Nanotechnology is still a technology we know nothing about in the *human body*.  

The general public seems to be ignorant to the shadows of new technology in the face of their immediate needs.

#### Going Forward

Nano technology has greater potential to destroy than the atomic bomb, yet greater potential for the benefits of humanity than the digital revolution.

A full-fledged *nano-society* will polarize the heaven and hell duality or inequality even more.

This is why evolving as a species beyond **ego** is so important, so we do not suffer and kill each other trying to alleviate it.

### Environment / Population

Does global population bother any of the *hypnotised unconscious problematic humans*, such as my "self"?

Does the vaccine have an effect on the environment?  What scenarios would play out to mitigate any?

How much will it cost?  Does it have inequality implications?

### Politics

Does the political timing of it bother anyone?

Perhaps it was released now in a *democratic US* as more *favourable* to its potential failure.

Does anyone wonder why its a Canadian company developing the nano-tech?  Or why the US does not have nano technology to do it themselves? 

Perhaps a strategic advantage to maintain unity in the US upon disaster or more inequality.  Or maybe competition to produce more.

Well, Canadians have opened Pandora's box on nano-tech into mainstream.

## Conclusion

- Nano-tech is not to be taken lightly at all.
- I still don't trust the US, corporations, or any other collective ego driven by profit.
- Normal life sucks whether its new-normal, new-new-normal or just abnormal.
- Pandemics, super bugs, global population and un-sustainability will continue.
