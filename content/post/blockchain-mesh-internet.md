Using [the blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) mesh network routers allow freedom and payments.

The underlying core of bitcoin, the blockchain is a system that can be applied to a variety of uses.

One particular disruptive use, that is not mentioned on the wiki, is **mesh networks**.

Like AI, nanotech or self driving cars, the technology has it's criticisms of being advantageous to criminals (IMHO the lesser of evils).

## Concept

The idea and benefits are simple enough:

1. a hardware router/device that shares a network
2. blockchain network protocols system software
3. network payments and transactions free of the internet
4. boundary expanded for the internet of things (IoT) devices
5. self-forming and healing networks
6. get paid for expanding the network
7. local communities cut out the middleman

## Architecture

If you know the [Open Systems Interconnections (OSI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model) model, the blockchain mesh network focuses on layers 1-3 (the **physical**, **data link** and **network**).

## Providers

If you are curious check these providers and their whitepapers.  It will take a lot of adoption to get going, hence this blog post.

## [Ammbr](https://www.ammbr.com/)

Has the most interesting modular mesh device and mobile app in my opinion.  

## [Althea](https://althea.net/)

Another blockchain mesh system that uses firmware installs on existing commercial routers.

## [SmartMesh.io](https://smartmesh.io/)

A p2p mesh protocol making good progress in cooperative with [meshbox](https://meshbox.network/) as a device/router.

## [MeshBox](https://meshbox.network/)

A router device for mesh networks for next generation Huawei and Cisco technologies.

## [Theta Token](https://www.thetatoken.org/)

A similar technology focusing on p2p networks for video processing.

Shows that the mesh tech can be broken down for a specific use case.
