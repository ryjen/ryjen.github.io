You might have heard of the blues, made famous as a way to make a living in the US for marginalized citizens.

The story goes that the French taught the Black community music theory and unlocked a creative juice thirsting for expression.

12 bar blues is very basic music lesson and is known universally by musicians who need a way to quickly join other musicians musically on the road.

It is called 12 bar blues from the number of bars used to play one repetition in common time.

## Scales: a quick primer

The most common western scale - the major scale - has **7** notes representing **pitch**.

In **any key or scale**, they can be referred to by **roman numerals**: `I-II-III-IV-V-VI-VII`

In **C major** the note names are:

<pre>
C: <b>the root</b>
D: the second
E: the third
F: <b>the fourth</b>
G: <b>the fifth</b>
A: the sixth
B: the seventh
</pre>

## Rhythm: a quick primer

Rhythm time signatures consist of **beats** per **bar**.

A **bar** is a measure of **time** for beat **duration**'s (quarter note, half note, full note).

The most popular time signature **4/4** is also called common time. Each bar consists of **4 beats** of **quarter notes (1/4)**.

One bar of **4/4** rhythm can be vocalized as `one and two and three and four`.

## 12 bar blues: Notes

The notes used in the 12 bar blues are the **root**, **fourth** and **fifth** (I - IV - V).

In key of **C** from the example on scales, the notes used would be: **C** - **F** - **G**.

## 12 bar blues: Rhythm

The rhythm formula in terms of **bars per key change**:

`4 - 2 - 2 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1`

The total of those numbers is **12**.

You might also see a pattern with **4** and its sums: `4 = 2 + 2 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1`

If we apply the roman numerals **I - IV - V** from a scale to this pattern it looks like:

`I I I I - IV IV - I I - V - IV - I - V`

That is how the rhythm pattern looks in any key or scale.

## Bringing it on home

Applying note values to the previous pattern in the key of **A**, the 12 bar blues now looks like:

`C C C C - F F - C C - G - F - C - G`

To break that down:

1. 4 bars of I (C)
2. 2 bars of IV (F)
3. 2 bars of I (C)
4. 1 bar of V (G)
5. 1 bar of IV (F)
6. 1 bar of I (C)
7. 1 bar of V (G) also called the 'turnaround' back to the beginning.

Oh, how convenient, that is also **7 key changes**, just like the number of notes in a scale. **Lucky 7** I guess.

## Practising and Next

Get a feel for the notes, and use a metronome to count the rhythm per bar as you play them.

There is a lot of things you can do to add flavor to the blues.

- solo in major/minor scales or different modes
- 'Walking' the notes in the scale
- lead in/lead out notes on beats
- 'turnaround' riffs
- rhythm changes
- pattern variations
