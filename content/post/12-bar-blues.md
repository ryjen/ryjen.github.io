You might have heard of the blues, made famous as a way to make a living in the US for marginalized citizens.

The story goes that the French taught the Black community music theory and unlocked a creative juice thirsting for expression.

12 bar blues is very basic music lesson and is known universally by musicians who need a way to quickly join other musicians musically on the road.

It is called 12 bar blues from the number of bars used to play one repetition in common time.

## Scales: a quick primer 🎼

The most common western scale - the major scale - has **7** notes representing **pitch**.

In **any key or scale**, they can be referred to by **roman numerals**: `I · II · III · IV · V · VI · VII`

In **C major** the note names are:

<pre>
C: <b>the first, root or <i>tonic</i></b>
D: the second
E: the third
F: <b>the fourth</b>
G: <b>the fifth</b>
A: the sixth
B: the seventh
</pre>

## Rhythm: a quick primer 🥁

Rhythm time signatures consist of **beats** per **bar**.

A **bar** is a measure of **time** for beat **duration**'s (quarter note ♩, eighth note ♪, etc).

The most popular time signature **4/4** is also called common time. Each bar consists of **4 beats** of **quarter notes (♩ = 1/4)**. It can be vocalized simply as `one, two, three, four`.

A time signature of **5/8** would mean **5 beats** of **eighth notes (♪ = 1/8)**. It can be vocalized as `one and two and three and four and five`.

## 12 bar blues: Chords

The chords used in the 12 bar blues are the **root**, **fourth** and **fifth** (I · IV · V).

Using these basic melodic notes we can create a rythm pattern for any key.

In key of **C** from the example on scales, the notes used would be: **C** - **F** - **G**.

The **chord progression** starts out simple and progressively gets more complicated before repeating.

## 12 bar blues: Rhythm and Changes

As a intro, the 12 bar blues rhythm formula looks like

`4 · 2 · 2 · 1 · 1 · 1 · 1`

It is in terms of **bars per chord progression**, meaning each value is a complete **bar** of `one two three four` in common time.

If we apply the roman numerals **I - IV - V** from a scale to this pattern it looks more like:

`I I I I · IV IV · I I · V · IV · I · V`

It will make more sense in the next section so just remember the fist _chord progression_ (I to IV) is four bars followed by two bars and so on.

It is also intersting that the total of those numbers is **12**, hence the name **12 bar blues**.

You might also see a pattern with **4** and its sums: `4 = 2 + 2 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1`

## Bringing it on home 🎸

Applying note values to the previous pattern in the key of **C**, the 12 bar blues now looks like:

`C C C C · F F · C C · G · F · C · G`

To break that down:

1. 4 bars of C (I)
2. 2 bars of F (IV)
3. 2 bars of C (I)
4. 1 bar of G (V)
5. 1 bar of F (IV)
6. 1 bar of C (I)
7. 1 bar of G (V) also called the 'turnaround' back to the beginning.

Oh, how convenient, that is also **7 key changes**, just like the number of notes in a scale. **Lucky 7** I guess.

## Practising and Next

Get a feel for the notes, and use a metronome to count the rhythm per bar as you play them.

There is a lot of things you can do to add flavor to the blues.

- solo in major/minor scales or different modes
- 'Walking' the notes in the scale
- lead in/lead out notes on beats
- 'turnaround' riffs
- rhythm changes
- pattern variations
