The [wikipedia on art in the 21st century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_century#Arts_and_entertainment) is hilariously lacking.

There are some great artists out there, who get overlooked compared to disasters, in-equality or technology.  The art itself is reflected by that as resembling pornography or violence.

The mediums in which art is delivered has a digital / non-digital divide that correlates with the 21st century.  

The first 20 years have been a digital revolution, allowing greater quality and delivery of digitized content.  The next are prepped for adding automated intelligence to that.

Curious how distracted it feels, rebounding in trauma from the constant suffering and crises. 

## What is art anyway?

To me, and perhaps others, art is all about content for the human senses that is pleasing to an individual in some way.  Through meaning, emotions, activity, memory or experience.

The ability to recreate reality in an alternate or skillful way.

### Audio

Our ancestor's have categorized acoustic pitches into scales and developed genius ways of transcribing them and understanding how the interact together with many different instruments.

The natural human voice and acoustic instruments, tube amplifiers and that creamy smooth wave sound.  Also live performances.

### Visual

Video art is more or less about some sort of plot, content or communication.   As fiction, non-fiction or educational.  

### Other

Sounds wonderful, but the shadow side is that when humans are the subject of art, there is an undesired effect of emphasizing the past or biasing something that is temporary or you cannot control, as who you are.  It is not quite vanity, it is deeper and less obvious.


## How has the 21st century changed art?

The digital realm was induced with [moore's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) and the exponential increase of storage capacity and computing speed.

The inefficiencies associated with creating, editing and distributing content were improved.  Distribution over the internet became disruptive to existing industries.

Streaming content became feasible with faster connection speeds.

## How will the 21st century change art?

One can only look at human nature and how the digital age did with trends like Artificial Intelligence.

Given the ability to art that is indistinguishable from reality, what if we cannot tell the difference anymore?  What if it becomes more immersive?

A major paradigm shift will be required of our consciousness to adapt to considering that we can no longer determine what is **art** and what is **real** (Psychoanalyst's have been doing it for years)

Consider a few examples:

### Audio

- [Creating human voices that sound exactly like a real person](https://youtu.be/DWK_iYBl8cA)
- Audio recognition
- Autonomous song generation that is pleasing to an audience, or makes the top 10 (Deep Fake Music, Milli Vanilli AI)

### Photo

- [auto-generated realistic human face photos](https://generated.photos/faces)
- The more scary aspects are from image recognition as it relates to privacy, law-enforcement, Captcha breaking.

### Video 

- [transforming a persons face into another](https://youtu.be/VWrhRBb-1Ig) mid stream and so seamless you cannot see it happen.
- Hybrid human / animated films and animated films that seemly completely realistic.
- Autonomous generation of entire stories, actors and the associated audio/video.
