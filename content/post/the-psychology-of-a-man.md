Been doing some self work during the infamous covid-19.

This will not appeal to the men who are deathly afraid of anything feminine outside of the context of sports or a bar.  

So if that is you, you should go ahead and keep to your house of cards if that makes you happy.

I share these insights publicly because I guess it is a way of attempting to disintegrate my shadow self in the light from which it came - the world.

## Required knowledge

- **[Shadow Self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_(psychology))** the unconscious ego.
- **[Anima/Animus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anima_and_animus)** the unconscious feminine/masculine side of a man/woman respectively.
- **[Rite of Passage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rite_of_passage)** a transition of significant change in society.  Most commonly to adulthood.
- **[The Mother Complex](https://jungny.com/mother-complex/)** a part of everyone's psyche as experiences with the image of mother.
- Only 17% of men in a north american survey had a positive relationship with their father.
- **Complex** an energy of the psyche in different areas.
- I love my family to the best of my ability.

## A tribal background


### father

My father was a man who had mythical wild stories of rebellion and fun. 

To me he was defined by middle age and living in the castle suffering the wound that does that heal. 

He was shamed by the stereotype of not living up to the role of external provider. 

He medicated the chronic dilemma with a pot addiction and over valuing the woman in his life.

He was a great musical mentor and hockey coach. 

Driven by emotions, and overly compensative of not being like his strict parents.

Like most fathers, he had little capacity to give attention to a son.

Especially one becoming disgruntled of instability, loneliness and our status in the tribe as men.

### mother 

She was a loving person with her own myths of rebellion and fun. 

She had an innate ability for happiness, never a negative mood.  

The times I did run into her shadow self, they were of her being embarrassed of failure:

Either as a parent of me, or my father as a choice.

She had an external relationship that caused havoc on my father, despite meeting him and hoping they would prevail.


### sister

A younger sister, we were closing when we were younger and more isolated.

As we got older we were very much mimicks of the parental roles: me entering the shame camp, and her entering the success camp.

Her new found sexuality and social life fit well in the success camp.

My loss of the protective brother role with her older friends fit well in the shame camp.

She was never there for me socially or in my troubled times. But she was for our father or her friends.  Not that it matters, we are different camps anyway.

### me, oh me, oh why

My rite of passage as a youth was incomplete as it is with many.  Started out mimicking the myths of rebellion but did not find much fun in it. 

The reality of instability of the tribe was becoming increasingly apparent.  My failed first love was another milestone in the camp of shame.


My biggest mistake at the time was asking to see a shrink just from pure loneliness.   It did not help, and the stigma was another milestone in camp shame.

My inability to cope with the alienation and indignation of my life needed an answer and was turning to blind anger. 

My father must have been dealt with me in the same way he was dealt with - exclusion from the tribe.  A final blow of shame.

The ordeal was forced, and not by choice.  There would be no symbolic death/rebirth of the child, or critical teachings on how to live, and no going home psychologically.

The physical return home created an even deeper seed of shame and anger that was now stunted and internalized as deep depression. 

Which to my utter lack of respect for waiting until after my ordeal, the shame of the dysfunctional family finally broke up for good too.

Over the next 10 or so years I am a broken adult-child-zombie seeking a hug from a tribe that has moved on.  

I lose my self completely in the online world.  My broken attempts to fill the need for a teacher with individual parents seem to result in them finding spouses to avoid it, and new painful traumatizing ordeals for me.

At the most desperate and critical point of a zombie existence something in me **of my own will** reached out for help.

An ironically, all it took was to be of my own will to change the zombie into something with at least half a brain.

### the trials

Freud says that the tribe revolves around the most damaged member.  Usually whoever is in the shame camp, my father or I.

After my ordeals, for some reason the rest of my so-called "tribe" or family underwent major transformations:

1. the mother emerges to play her role, dragging and dropping a pesky man thing before picking up a new one
2. the sister drops her marriage and immediately enters a new one at the same time
3. the father's marriage ends a few years later and is back in the camp of shame

It shocked and angered me to find I still have absolutely no defence to the anima.

I feel like apologizing to the people that follow in my life for the next 10 years after this period because it is ultimately another ordeal that narrowly escaped more trauma.  With more distraction in greater scope and little chance of success.

### middle age

So a cave-man lifespan now wasted in total incompleteness at the mercy of the external, I now turn to spiritualism.  

Attempting to recognize **the most reduced self I am** to annihilate the last of the ego, anger, anima, and an absent tribe that never was.

To truly accept what is, what is not, and turn the page.  

Can sense my withdraw like a conditioned response to the end of another personal ordeal.

And an eventual attempt at another rite of passage, forced or not I do not know.  

But something is different recognizing the futility of that, and the futility of finding meaning in anything to do with work, people or personal life.


A strange sense of peace comes with that, even on shaky pandemic grounds.
