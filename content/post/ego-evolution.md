Remembering a concept from the book [Sapiens](https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316095) (paraphrasing):

> Ape hierarchy only existed in small groups with a limit (150 or so) with a dominant leader (alpha). This applies to humans as well, but we were able so surpass the threshold with myths and better communication.

And the definition of ego by [ET](https://eckharttolle.com/) ðŸ‘½:

> A complete and total identification with form as who you are - a thought form or a physical form.

### Observe

It is apparent that **human communication** keeps **improving on a logarithmic scale**, starting with cave drawings, language, writing, phone, tv, internet, etc.

In the last 20th century we have seen communication grow with technology. 

### Combine

The conclusion is that the **strength of the ego** that enabled us to **survive without communication**, is ironically somewhat **diminished with more of it**.

The more interconnected we become the more we cannot ignore previously unseen problems or rely on physical borders to keep out change.

### Result

The result is things are getting better (ego diminishing) and worse (reaction to strengthen) at the same time (and the worse is louder than the good, as ðŸ‘½ points out).

The **choices in evolution**:

* continue to strengthen the egoic collectives and myths

* recognize it as not who we are and unnecessary

Most of the dysfunction we see happening today is the unconscious reaction to strengthen the diminishing ego.

We have been a witness to the horrors of multiple global wars in just the latest century.
 
### Outro

I feel we are on a tight rope in a circus of humanity, a balancing act trying not to annihilate ourselves

...before the next evolution in human communication becomes clear (bigger than 5g).

Continuing to try and strengthen fragile cathedral like myths and institutions is dangerous and futile serving only personal identities for the sake of the earth.
