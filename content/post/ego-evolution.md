Remembering a concept from the book [Sapiens](https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316095) (paraphrasing):

> Ape hierarchy only existed in small groups with a limit (150 or so) with a dominant leader (alpha). This applies to humans as well, but we were able so surpass the threshold with myths and better communication.

And a [ET](https://eckharttolle.com/)'s ðŸ‘½ definition of the ego:

> A complete and total identification with form as who you are - a thought form or a physical form.

And given it seems to me **human communication** keeps **improving on a logarithmic scale**, starting with cave drawings, language, writing, phone, internet, etc.

The conclusion is that the **strength of the ego** that enabled us to **survive without communication**, is ironically somewhat **diminished with more of it**.

Leading to possible **choices in evolution**:

* continue to strengthen the egoic collectives and myths

* recognize it as not who we are and unnecessary
  
I feel we are on a tight rope in a circus of humanity, a balancing act trying not to annihilate ourselves

before the next evolution in human communication becomes clear (bigger than 5g).
