Remembering a concept from the book [Sapiens](https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316095) (paraphrasing):

> Ape hierarchy only existed in small groups with a limit (150 or so) with a dominant leader (alpha). This applies to humans as well, but we were able so surpass the threshold with myths and better communication.

And the definition of ego by [ET](https://eckharttolle.com/) ðŸ‘½:

> A complete and total identification with form as who you are - a thought form or a physical form.

### Observe

It is apparent that **human communication** keeps **improving on a logarithmic scale**, starting with cave drawings, language, writing, phone, tv, internet, etc.

In the last century to today we have seen communication grow with technology. 

Artificial intelligence aims to bring the mass amounts of technological data into something consumable and communicable.

5g aims to increase the speed of our technological communication.

### Combining

The **strength of the ego** that enabled us to **survive without much communication**, is ironically somewhat **diminished with more of it**.

The more interconnected we become the more we cannot ignore **previously unseen problems** or rely on **physical borders to keep out change**.

Most of the dysfunction we see happening today is the **unconscious reaction** to strengthen the diminishing ego (we know not what we do!).

We have been a witness to the horrors of multiple global wars in just the latest century.

### Result

The **choices in evolution**:

* continue to strengthen the egoic collectives and myths

* recognize it, and as not who we are or unnecessary

It is getting better (ego diminishing) and worse (reaction) at the same time, as ðŸ‘½ puts it.

Institutions and countries seem to either:

* transfer the ownership to its people in avoidance, who are no different, so same result

* rule with a heavy hand or fear to avoid the loss of its people, but same result


### Outro

We are on a tight rope in a circus of humanity. A balancing act trying not to annihilate ourselves.

The next evolution in human communication may be more disruptive than AI or 5g with nanotechnology.

My personal opinion is that continuing to try and strengthen fragile cathedral like myths and institutions is dangerous and futile.  Serving only personal or collective identities.

Apple's 2014 slogan "You are more powerful than you think" is an interesting one.

Earth deserves better for keeping us, evolve!
