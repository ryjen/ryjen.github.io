I watch them beat you,

Watch them beat you down.

There is nothing I can do,

Brother, just like you.

So when things go wrong,

Go wrong with you,

It hurts me too.

---

They say you know,

You know what to do.

It is so common,

So common its true.

Because things cant go wrong,

Go wrong with you,

It is so untrue.

---

I watch them steal,

Your whole life away.

There is nothing I can do,

It happened to me too.

So when things go wrong,

go wrong with you,

I feel it too.

---

You cannot be

What you want,

To make it happen.

All we do is suffer,

All of the time.

So when things are wrong,

So wrong with you,

It kills me too.

---

You always find a reason,

To deny me dignity.

Your fragile construct,

Is under threat.

So when I put you down,

Down into the ground,

I hurts me too.

---

You say I do not know love,

Or deserve it too.

The levels of existence,

I had to accept,

Prove it so.

So when things don't love,

Don't love you,

I don't care too.
