To belong in the world

One must display a belief

In of love

Without risk

---

To belong in the world

One must display 

Kindness and responsibility

Being the bringer of life.

To belong in this world

One must display

Total confidence 

and denial of failure.

To belong in this world

One must display

A positive mind

And forgive your self when not.

Hoorah hoorah, you now belong in the world.

Bitterly fights to control

Struggles to understand

Blames and resists

Hoorah hoorah, you will learn again
