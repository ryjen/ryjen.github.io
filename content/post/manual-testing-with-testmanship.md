There are still times when we are forced to test manually. I could not find cheap, easy to use software for this kind of thing, usually defaulting to an excel or word document.

I've started [testmanship.com](http://testmanship.com) to see if I can breathe new life into manual testing and hopefully give it more visibility to teams.
