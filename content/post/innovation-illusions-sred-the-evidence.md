Most of the software industry in Canada is fueled by the [Scientific Research and Experimental Development Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program.html).

Every job I have ever worked has used it, most quite extensively.

The program is basically is looking for innovation in Canada. 

Proving time spent **advancing an uncertainty**, such as **researching** or doing **experimental development**, earns you benefits.

In my opinion, the program is **exploited** and creates a large dependency.

## Benefit Bourgeois

Depending on who forwards the benefits cheque, they may have different opinions on who deserves it:

* the highly educated only, who live in a institutionalized bubble
* the socialists who are somewhat incompetent in regards to real competition


## Software Realities

The difference between a computer scientist and a computer engineer is only the *constraints they work under*.

*Uncertainty* in software comes from:

* lack of experience
* lack of understanding of desired outcome
* lack of knowledge from stakeholders or communication
* lack of time

The software industry in Canada is mostly inherited from America and built around producing without such a benefit.

Thus the SRED program offers very little in relief from software engineering constraints.

The software industry works in iterative sprints that:

* have deadlines for selling
* offer no real freedom for innovation or experimentation

We are funded for advancing technology, yet the methods in which we operate inhibit such.  A colossal failure and scam.
