Yes, [rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) is really funny.

{{<rawhtml>}}<img alt="rubber duck" class="pull-right" src="/image/blog/duck.png">{{</rawhtml>}}

The [wiki](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/), a [dedicated site](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/) or [coding horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/rubber-duck-problem-solving/) explain it pretty well.

It is a fantastic methodology because there is no other human to try and take advantage of your stupidity - implicitly (unconsciously) or explicitly (capitalism).

Like media and technology which this world loves and wants to be (metro techno star).... There is a shadow side.

To me the story says something about doing programming in the bathtub with a computer.


### Scenario 1:  The guru

The story is of the ancient duality of good and evil.  Or for the business world, programmers and sales people.

Nobody in the business world, or the user world gives a rats ass about programmer problems.  They just want it to work.

{{<rawhtml>}}<img alt="yellow submarine" style="float: left" src="/image/blog/sub.png" />{{</rawhtml>}}

While most programmers know the problems they solve are not insignificant, it is ultimately irrelevant in the fast paced world and duality.

Some spend a lifetime solving them with little to show for it, thinking things will change.

It is at this point, a programmer will turn to the dark side and on their own kind.

One day while giving their kids a bath with a yellow submarine and fretting over problems, they realize they are in the bathtub with a computer.

Deciding enough is enough, they effectively duck out of any responsibility to the skillful lost art.

Anyone trying to make it so will be told to **go tell it to a rubber duck in the bathtub, because that is what that stuff makes me want to do**.


### Scenario 2:  The manager

Again a story of the ancient duality of go(o)d (gooooooo-gle) and (e)vil (eVILLIAN).

The manager has intentions of being organized and everyone being happy.

If there is money in allowing others to do things, why not.

But the programmers are a needy bunch.  They require constant recognition of their meaningless suffering.

It is destiny for them not to receive it, at least in the way they want, so they will start to turn on the manager.

After a while, the manager becomes hardened as their job position becomes threatened.

Anyone trying to discuss programming problems become a part of the resistance, and thus told to **go tell it to a rubber duck in the bathtub, because that is what that stuff makes me want to do**.

### Scenario 3:  The newbie

Again a story of the ancient duality of winner (win her) and loser (lost time).

The newbie is extremely passionate about the power of programming and believes that its the most important thing in the universe.

They want to engage in it constantly and resist anyone who does not agree.

They do not realize that their passion is slowly being capitalized on by the enemy who knows it will pass.

When their own peers do not want to engage with them or the winners, the programmer is forced to do as a solitary pursuit.

And thus, **willingly programs with the rubber duck, effectively ducking out of the rest of life**.
