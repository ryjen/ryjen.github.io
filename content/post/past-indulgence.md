## Hello, World

Trying to find at least zero motivation for the tech industry instead of negative infinity.

Do not normally focus too much on the past, but it might be worth investigating for a source redemption from the conditions that negate me.

But if you cannot be bothered to read more than 500 characters about someone else, here is the TL;DR:

This is a moot point.

## 80's

Family had a [Mac Classic](https://images.app.goo.gl/2tfgqmqPSdWz53RZ9) in the 80's

Pretty forward thinking to name your "new" product "classic".

The baby boomers loved it, and so did I.

Paint, and [missile command](https://youtu.be/QIxGW4Ns1UI).

Primitive but just as good as my old Atari.

## 90's

The dark ages in the 90's I spent most of time (too much) in some sort of remote *nix shell thanks to a friendly Alaskan bear.

We worked on a game that had some users, I learned a ton, and even experienced my first coder burnout.

(Burnout is an accumulation of tech problems and real-life problems.  Have never seen one without the other).

Still had an older mac II type thing but mostly switched to Windows.

## Millennium

Finally clued in that I should get higher ed, thanks to yet another helpful stranger.

Revelation came with OSX and a pseudo *nix layer.  Joygasm!

A wonderful period of renaissance for all!  Can score a job!

Internet of phones! (TCP!)

## Current

Now the mobile Apple has been bit.

My edu was disappointing, and the jobs, more so.

The stratosphere of ego is extra ordinary (and more intolerant).

I find my self longing for the underground again.

Going back to linux and C, it

is another sign of apple dark ages for me.

Has always been there for me.

## Future, Reflection

Gophers to me are the meek, that will inherit the earth, when the ego dinosaurs, money monkeys, and wannabe's become extinct.

I cannot really see myself enjoying the industry or its people again.

But maybe thats why its called "Work", but its like the alien in American Dad, where not allowed to be a jerk is like poison.

A dream scenario would be something like a "lighthouse maintainer" on a remote island somewhere with satalite.

Where I can piddle away on side stuff in "off time" as needed and retire on a gov pension.
