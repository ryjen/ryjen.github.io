##### Major Lessons

- I have a dense pain body accumulated from abandoment and rejection.  

- The pain body is a parasitic entity that lives inside us as the emotional aspect of the ego.  It feeds on and accumulates negativity over time.

- My ego is ambivalent - both wanting attention and fearing it.

- The ego is pathological, collective, unconcious and unfortunately completely normal.

- Surrendering to what is and Being Present is a powerful life changing tool.  Resistence is always the ego.

##### Background, Dark Ages, Ego Whining, Unfactual Facts, Me Myself and I

From an early age, when my mother was embarassed, her reaction would be to abandon me to teach me a lesson (like leaving a crying child alone in a store untill it realizes its alone).  It was very effective and probably the same lesson she taught my father by having an affair.

I absorbed a lot of hidden toxic feelings from my parents.  First when they were together, then after they divorced each individually with their successive partners.  Drugs were always present in my family and my own attempts at mimicing them failed.  We moved around a lot.  Several different homes, and at least 4 high schools.  My first girlfriend had let me go and released a huge pain response.  Anger did develop, but luckily I avoided any major violence.

My first group home was the result of dropping out of high school.  I could not cope.   I never felt comfortable talking with the people that work in that field, or putting up a fight, so that in-itself became the issue (yeah theres a fancy term that can apply).   Ultimately, the home did nothing to help and contributed to a 10 year downward spiral of more pain and abandonment.  The residents were abusive.  The staff either did not have much concern or were told not to.  The worst part is the rejection and coming "home".  In hindsight, I see that my family's collective ego might have hoped that was the end, but we never talked about it.  With the same toxic environment and a divorce, it lead to more of the same cycle over the next years.  Now they had found a way to avoid any responsibility or need for a relationship in lieu of their own lives and suffering.

Becoming an adult did little to help... I lacked the healing and guidance.  Felt I had lost my family, friends, future and self respect.  A job carried little motivation for me. 

Eventually my life situation was too hopeless and I surrendered to the mental health system (Guess before, it was physical presence only).  As soon as that happened and it was my own choice, I started getting better and breezed through it.  Luckily there were some good people that helped, without whom it could have been a lot worse (There was now another term for me - "high functioning").  Was able to quit smoking and go to the gym. 

##### The Positive Side, Yin Yang, Die to the Past

Stuck in the system leads to a lot of free time.  I was able to drop myself into the internet and programming to escape the reality of the situation. I used the system to go back to school for computer science. I had no idea at all how advanced I had become in programming thanks to open-source. 

Being able to control something like software was a welcome contrast to feeling like I had no control on my life.

The suffering deepened me and I am able to understand completely what Eckhart is teaching now.

##### The Aftermath, Possible Relapse? Midlife crisis?

I've gone through wierd phases of 100% not hiding my past and declaring it, too keeping it as private as I can.  Still not sure what the best approach is.   These days stigma is a very real problem with drug epidemics, terrorists and hardliners.  I think the best policy is - "I have little use for it".

The choice of part-time schooling too keep my health had the opposite effect.  I wasted too much time and now have lost revenue and more frustration.  The education system seems designed to keep you in part-time as long as possible while they constantly change the curriculum (albeit thats the nature).  When I had the option to join the workforce it was very difficult.  It seems the quality of this system over time is also making things difficult.

I had decided to fake forgiving my parents just to move on.  This was also a regretful decision as it only reinforced their ego position.  I recently found forgiveness in that they did it unconciously. I suppose I did as well.

I was never able to have a real relationship. I have had relationships, but while they were very enjoyable I would consider them more experiments.  I've noticed that when family gets involved it's not a good thing for me, but I hope at some level I expected that.

I am nearing the point of no return for having kids (not an egg thing, I'm just becoming more tired).   It's wierd because I may not even want them, but a part of me laments not being able to, and is causing more pain.

My career and education situation started out as a good redemption point in my life.  But it has degraded into being kinda wishful thinking and being burned out and insecure.  A very real lack of benefit, motivation and options loom over me.

Never really felt a resolution or acknowledgement of who I really am (which I've learned is the awareness that everything happens in).  

Being too old for change is also a source of pain now, perhaps mistakenly so.

##### Conclusion

Dunno, but I'm present.
