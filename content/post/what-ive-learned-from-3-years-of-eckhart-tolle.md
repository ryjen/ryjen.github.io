## Major Lessons

Eckhart Tolle is a unique individual who experienced a radical shift in thinking after disassociating with an especially negative fictional self.  After learning what happened to him, he became a "spiritual teacher", travelling the world writing, helping, and reminding people they can live without their own suffering. 

I'm going to attempt paraphrasing the major takeaways I've received after following, reading and watching Eckhart Tolle over the last 4 years.   Most people have to be ready (some form of extreme circumstances that trigger a need), but hopefully you will be able to relate the concepts to yourself as well.

#### Ego

Eckhart defines the ego as such: "Identification of the self in form, as a thought form or a physical form. 

In small examples "I am awesome" (which you may very well be, but its not who you are).  Or "this car is me".

According to Eckhart, and it is really hard to disagree with him, the ego is a fundamental dysfunction of humans and we all suffer from it, including Eckhart.  

A few enlightened individuals have appeared about 2500 years ago (Budda, Jesus, Lao), but the basic dysfunction has not really needed to evolve until the time we are presently in.   Given the amount of dysfunction in the last 20th century with world wars, population, technological and environmental doomsdays humans face a stark choice.  Evolve beyond the Ego or die.

Eckhart likes to depict the ego as a fictional mind-made entity "little me" that lives inside us.  Most people "identify" with it and are completely wrapped up in satisfying its needs as if without it, they would cease to exist.   It is always needy, comparing, always causing suffering to its host and others in very cunning ways.  It can be hard to distinguish.

Its also important to identify the collective human ego as well. As anything that separates you and others from the "oneness" of all things in the universe.  Things like gender, wealth, location, politics, etc, are all things that the ego will use.

I'll just add my own two cents on the ego, I think introverts have an "ambivalent ego" that both craves and fears attention.  I'm not an extrovert, but the extrovert ego is the classic ego - loud, demanding attention, unconcious.

The sad part about humanity is that being in service of the ego is considered completely normal despite its pathological tendencies.

#### Pain Body

If you've ever felt like you were acting out uncontrollably, as if something just didn't feel right. Ekhart has given it a name - "the Pain Body" so its easier to identify.  You might not even notice it because the pain body is in the service of the ego.

The pain body is probably what prompted Eckhart to use the term "Unconciousness" so liberally, as when the pain body is active, you are not present.  You are completely and totally identified with the pain.  In some senses, the definition of evil.

#### The present momemt

Eckhart suggests salvation is always in the present moment.  He reminds you that both the past, and present, don't exist!  Where is the past?  Where is the future and does it ever appear as expected?  

In fact, most problems in your mind only exist in the past or the future!  Recognition of the fact your problems don't exist in the now can completely dissolve the ego.

In fact your so called "life" only ever consists of the present moment.... always and forever.  "You are life, you don't have a life".

#### Conclusion

As someone who has had a somewhat "checkered" past with a lot of suffering and shame.... Eckharts teachings were like turning on a lightbulb in a basement.

His teachings have radically transformed how "I" think about existence and my role in it.

I've travelled to some of his retreats, explored books he's read and found inspiring, watched countless videos and it all points to the same truth.  

Dunno what will happen with the present moment in the future, but I will be present for it!
