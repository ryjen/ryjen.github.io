Well I spent some time put a web front end to some java code I made a long time ago for a [MUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD)

The [project](http://github.com/ryjen/mudharbour) is a decent example of Jersey, SocialAuth and WebSockets with some other nifty things (taken from other frameworks - like flash messages).

I've gone back and forth with many java web frameworks but my current favorite is Jersey (an implementation of JAX-RS, gives REST simplicity)

Its probably of no interested to anyone but me but thats never stopped me before.

The source [is on github](http://github.com/ryjen/mudharbour)

I've added an [area file importer](http://mudharbour.coda.life/admin/import), so I can import some existing worlds.
