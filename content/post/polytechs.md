Politics is always a **power struggle** to have the **ability** to make things **happen**.

There is no shortage of people who demand **action**.  Usually unconscious action.

This is not a revelation, politics is the **art of cultivating biases**.  It is great that the human condition is suffering, as there is a plethora of issues to take action on.

When it comes down to actionable issues that are most common, it is **children**.  **Save the puppies** first and foremost.  It all kind of bubbles up to that.

**Real change** like saving the environment, transcending ego, and peace will always conflict with that.

Great politician's know that *if you save enough puppies, you might have enough power to make the necessary disruptive changes*.

Given the *short term nature of service*, it is their destiny to fail once the *real change* is implemented and they are no longer saving the puppies.

**Real change** has another problem.  It is constrained by economics.  You may obtain the necessary power to make real change, but is useless without the economics to support it. 

Perhaps, the economic factor is just another way out of making the necessary disruptive changes.

Such was the **golden era of baby boomers** who's mass accumulated enough give power to change.  And also their failure for not making enough (Good thing Trudy has a last kick at the can while he could).


## The Canadian Parties

So this is my view:

### Liberals

Boomer ignorance town, whatever goes, as long as there is economics and power.

They will cultivate biases of oppression, intolerance and people not in touch with reality to get power.

### Conservatives

Really good accountants and perfect for government, but a too weird on the religion and intolerance.

They will cultivate biases instability, irresponsibility, insecure and a lack of safety to obtain power.

### NDP

The socialist alternative, will balance saving the puppies with real issues, but always lack lasting power

They will cultivate biases a lack of caring, and injustice to obtain power.

Green: 

The environment alternative, your puppies are better in the long run, but nobody has time for it.

They will cultivate biases of corporate ignorance.


[Rhino Party](https://www.partyrhino.ca/en/)

A joke party, with hilarious agendas that make fun of real ones. And they are **horny**!

They will cultivate biases of the irrelevance of politics.


## My Values

These days, I am sick of the common issues.  And I think most the actions we take in good faith, are either completely unnecessary or have very undesirable consequences.

My main grief though is that **single people** get screwed every time.

The average person lives, what, 80 years?

How much *pollution* do think that person produces in this society in time?

How many *resources* does that person require, 3 meals a day?

How much space does that person require to be free?

How much suffering does that person feel themselves or cause to others in that time?

Why should a **single person** by choice or not, have more difficulty financially or finding a place to live?

Politicians should **add up the cost of a child** and give that to me in a **tax break**.

Or find me a better half to make the mating decision with,

Because I would rather **save baby RJ** from a life sentence of 80 years hard labour with no parole.

And that actually leads me down another path of sexist inequality, child support or alimony.

Because if I was a woman, I would trick a man into impregnating me and then say:

"Beat it, give me a free pay cheque and I will keep the new company and caretaker when I am old."
