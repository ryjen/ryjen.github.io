Politics.  Does it matter?  Why?

It is great that the **human condition is suffering**, as there is a plethora of issues to take unconscious action on.

When it comes down to actionable issues that are most common, it is always **children**.

**Save the puppies** first and foremost.  It all kind of bubbles up to that.

**Real change** like saving the environment, technology, inequality, transcending the ego or peace always has an undesired effect that conflicts with the puppies.

Great politician's know that *if you save enough puppies, you might have enough power to make the necessary disruptive changes*.

Given the *short term nature of service*, it is destiny to fail. Once the *real change* is implemented, you lose power, or the *economics* were a problem.

Such was the **golden era of baby boomers** who's mass accumulated enough give power to change.  And also their failure for not making enough.  Good thing Trudy has a last kick at the can while he could eh?  It seemed to me his unpopular policies were only to build an economic war chest for **real change**.

## The Canadian Parties

So for what it is worth, this is my view:

### Liberals

Boomer ignorance town, whatever goes, as long as there is economics and power.

They will cultivate biases of oppression, intolerance and people not in touch with reality to get power.

### Conservatives

Really good accountants and perfect for government, but a too weird on the religion and intolerance.

They will cultivate biases of instability, irresponsibility, insecure and a lack of safety to obtain power.

### NDP

The socialist alternative, will balance saving the puppies with real issues, but always lack lasting power

They will cultivate biases of a lack of caring, and injustice to obtain power.

### Green

The environment alternative, your puppies are better in the long run, but nobody has time for it.

They will cultivate biases of corporate ignorance.


### [Rhino Party](https://www.partyrhino.ca/en/)

A joke party, with hilarious agendas that make fun of real ones. And they are **horny**!

They will cultivate biases of the irrelevance of politics.


## Single People

In acceptance with my current life circumstances, my main grief is that **single people** need some help.  

Am not talking about *child support* in *broken co-dependent relationships*

Why should only one income have more difficulty *financially* or finding a place to live? With or without children.

The average person lives, what, 80 years more or less hard labour?  With no hope for parole.

How much *pollution* do think that person produces in this society in time?

How many *resources* does that person requires, 3 meals a day, etc?

How much *space* does that person require to be **free**?

How much *money* does that person require to live that long?

How much suffering does that person feel themselves or cause to others in that time?

Politicians should **add up that cost** and give that to me in a **tax break** instead.  

Why should only the non-upper class families get the extra relief?

Yes, I suppose I just feel cut off from any reality that would support **baby RJ**.

A female polarity would show me the light, but I think society threw my rib away, trying to get theirs.
