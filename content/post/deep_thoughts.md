If you are familiar with 90s Saturday Night Live, you may be familiar with a skit called "Deep Thoughts with Jack Handy".

This is the simpleton who looks in the mirror and says the famous words "Your good enough, smart enough and gosh darn it.... people like you".

I tend to have an active mind, so going to log some deep thoughts:

# Deep Thoughts With RJ

### Relatively and Absolutely
Things that matter relatively but not absolutely include: everything.

### Responsibility
“Its up to you.”

### Authority
Seems like its always good intentions gone wrong.  A an imagined order that is written by an "author".  Turning the tables can create its own misplaced intentions.

### Money
I have cointempt.  Cleverly combines the words "contempt" and "coin". 

### When the Industry breaks me down
My core is linux and c.  The only thing that always brings passion.  

Yes nobody likes undefined behaviour (I look at it as the constant in the matrix that makes everything work).  

Linux has zombies, daemons, forks, etc. Whats not to like?  Its philosophy of everything is a file and small concise programs is sublime.

### Confidence
I don’t understand why its so important.  Or why its so important what other people think, that you have to have confidence.
I think its probably more confident to admit when you don’t have any.  Perhaps from a mating perspective confidence means no negativity and thus better social stability.  But it also means 99% ignorance.

### Death and Sleep
Is the delicious pull of sleep what death will be like?  So sweet it is.

### Trees in the Forest
If a tree (a person), falls in the forest (society), does any body hear it (care)?
