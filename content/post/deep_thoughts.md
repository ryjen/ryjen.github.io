If you are familiar with 90s Saturday Night Live, you may be familiar with a skit called "Deep Thoughts with Jack Handy".

This is the simpleton who looks in the mirror and says the famous words "Your good enough, smart enough and gosh darn it.... people like you".

I tend to have an active mind, so going to experiment putting some deep thoughts out:

# Deep Thoughts With RJ

### Relatively and Absolutely
Things that matter relatively but not absolutely include: everything. Everything is impermanent.

### Responsibility
“Its up to you.”

### Authority
Seems like its always good intentions gone wrong.  This may be because its a mythical order or only conceptual and doesn’t speak to something deeper.  Turning the tables can create its own misplaced intentions.

### Money
I have cointempt.  Cleverly combines the words "contempt" and "coin".  How anti-Capitalist/American. Contempt is defined as a mixture of disgust/boredom with anger/annoyance.

### When the Industry breaks me down
My core is linux and c.  The only thing that always brings passion.  
Yes nobody likes undefined behaviour (I look at it as the constant in the matrix that makes everything work).  

Rust ok, kinda weird, Go is maybe too simple.  C is just right.

Linux has zombies, reapers, forks and dumps, etc. Whats not to like?  Its design of everything is a file and small concise programs works brilliantly.

### Confidence
I don’t understand why its so important.  Or why its so important what other people think, that you have to have confidence.
I think its probably more confident to admit when you don’t have any.  Perhaps from a mating perspective confidence means no negativity and thus no violence.  But it also means 99% ignorance.

###  Reactivity
Its ironic that from a tech perspective being reactive is good, but from a business and personal perspective being reactive is not what you want (apple in the garden).

### Death and Sleep
Is the delicious pull of sleep what death will be like?  So sweet it is.

### Trees in the Forest
If a tree (a person), falls in the forest (society), does any body hear it (care)?
