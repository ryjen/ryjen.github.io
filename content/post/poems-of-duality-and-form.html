<p>
Take it for what you want.  There is ultimately very little meaning to life, we only try to find some in the suffering.  Perhaps my meaning is to express it in art form.

     <h2>Love Poem</h2>

   <pre>
Love is at the mercy of form

Without it, it may as not be real.

Form is merciless

At its peak and as it degrades.

<hr>

Love is a chemical delusion

That is dependent on others

To keep the chemicals flowing.

<hr>

Love is loyalty and trust

Devotion and passion.

Skewed by lack

And absenteeism in

A complex world.

<hr>

Love is a great tree

Of family and positivity

That casts a great shadow

Of solitude and negativity.

<hr>

Love will make you believe

You can overcome anything

With no regard to consequences.

<hr>

Love is persistent

As an unfulfilled need

For connection

Or a determined suffering

To unsuccessfully fill the need.

<hr>

Love is manifested 

As a child form

And used to give meaning

Justification, and hope.

<hr>

Love is a mother

Feeding and nurturing

But dependent and confined.

<hr>

Love is a family

Beating all odds

Until you grow out

And your needs interfere.

<hr>

Love is dead

And with it the insanity

Like god was declared as such

In 1882 by a madman.

<hr>

Love is greater than the singular

Universally and unconditionally free

As a part of the same "oneness"

Not some "thing" you can understand.

   <h2>Hate Poem</h2>

   <pre>
I hate the vastness

Of the horribly horrific machine

And its cold cruelty

Towards the soul.

<hr>
 
I hate their popularity

And their opinions

I hate their identities

And their actions

<hr>

I hate how they steal

And push with a smile

And act like it is deserved.

<hr>

I hate that there is no respite

When you are down, or wounded

In an advanced society 

that does more wounding than growing.

<hr>

I hate they believe

That there is help for us

When it is only good at

Helping them.

<hr>

I hate how they pretend

Things I say matter

When they do not.

<hr>

I hate the temporary nature

Of the conscious self

And the seemingly irrelevant nature

Of the unconscious self.

<hr>

I hate playing the game

I hate their rejection and problems

Without acceptance or reward

And their demand of separateness

<hr>

I hate their filtered perception

and irrational value system

of escapism through black

and white ideals.

<hr>

I hate how I need a friend

When all they do

Is bloody Caesar like family

With a stab in the back

<hr>

I hate how they feel the need

To protect others from my dilemma

Until the proverbial

Closet is opened for god.

<hr>

I hate you

And you hate me

Ain't it fun

Like a big purple people eating dinosaur.
