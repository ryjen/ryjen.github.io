The [wikipedia on art in the 21st century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_century#Arts_and_entertainment) is hilariously lacking.

Curious how distracted it all feels, rebounding in trauma from the constant suffering and crises. 

There are some great artists who get overlooked compared to *economics, disasters, in-equality or technology*.  The art itself is reflected by that merely resembles pornography or violence.

Art delivery has a digital / non-digital divide that correlates with the 21st century.  

The first 20 years have been a digital revolution.   Greater quality and delivery of digitized content.    The next, adding automated intelligence.

## What is art anyway?

Content for the human senses that is pleasing to an individual in some way.  

Through meaning, emotions, activity, memory or experience.

The ability to recreate reality in an alternate or skillful way.

### Audio

Our ancestor's have categorized acoustic pitches into scales.  Developing genius ways of transcribing them and how they interact together across instruments.

The analog world of natural human voices, live performances and tube amplifiers and that creamy smooth wave sound.

### Visual

Video art is more or less about some sort of plot, content or communication.   As fiction, non-fiction or educational.  

### Other

There is always a shadow side, as when humans are the subject of art.

*Emphasizing the form, the temporary or the past is a recipe for suffering for others and your self*.

It is not quite vanity, it is deeper and less obvious.  The 21st century and the internet has lifted the carpet and exposed the dirt.


## How has the 21st century changed art?

The digital realm was induced with [moore's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) and an exponential increase of storage capacity and computing speed.

The inefficiencies associated with creating, editing and distributing content were vastly improved.  

Distribution over the internet became disruptive to existing industries.

Streaming content became feasible with faster connection speeds.

## How will the 21st century change art?

One can only look at human nature and how the digital age did with trends like Artificial Intelligence.

Given the ability to art that is indistinguishable from reality, what if we cannot tell the difference anymore?  What if it becomes more immersive?

A major paradigm shift will be required of our consciousness to adapt to considering that we can no longer determine what is **art** and what is **real** (Psychoanalyst's have been doing it for years)

Consider a few examples:

### Audio

- [Creating human voices that sound exactly like a real person](https://youtu.be/DWK_iYBl8cA)
- Autonomous song generation that is pleasing to an audience, or makes the top 10

### Photo

- [Auto-generated realistic human face photos](https://generated.photos/faces)

### Video 

- [transforming a persons face into another](https://youtu.be/VWrhRBb-1Ig) mid stream and so seamless you cannot see it happen.
- Hybrid human / animated films and animated films that seemly completely realistic.
- Autonomous generation of entire stories, actors and the associated audio/video.

## Conclusion

There is none.  Nobody can predict the future and the past is a reflection of an ignorance we are incapable of escaping.

The challenge is how the monetary system and the psychology of alternate realities play into it.
