Who are you? Who am I?

Are you a body?

Are you a thought?

Are you more than a pin point in time?

If your body degenerates, are you still your body?

If your thought changes, are you still your thought?

Can you trust a body or a thought as who someone is if they change?

If you are a body, is love having another body to love yours through?

If you are a thought, is love having someone to tell it to?

If that is what love is, and it is based on temporary forms, is it still you?

Is requiring another polarity of form to complete you also bi-polar?

If you are aware of all your temporary forms, is that who you are?

If you are not aware, does that mean you do not know who you are?
