Something really positive about covid-19...

Is something that drives me wild with love 😍 and passion 😘

I am talking about the little extra plumpness to Canadian news anchors.

OMG, I am going to pleasantly die with desire 😈.

Am talking about you Vassy Kapelos and Rosemary Barton.

MMMMMMMMM can I suck on your necks and kiss everything?

Also a big fan of Adrienne Arsenault.  Can I get a date??

If I must acknowledge males, I like Ian Hanomansing.  Definitely **not** Andrew Chang.

Also amazing how attractive public health authorities are.

Am seriously in love with Dr. Bonnie Henry and the Albertan CMO (so cute).

Can I give you a back scratch or foot rub or something??

And Dr. Theresa Tam - that accent is so amazing.

Seriously, if I am gonna die, I just wanna lovuck  (love fuck).

When I get old, I demand that a nurse show me theirs while bathing me.

And put some medical assistance in my tea.

I am not talking about the career boy toy that is the Ontario CMO (Chief Media Officer).

Also the deaf translators have been saying more to me than the people talking.

Even though I do not understand hand gestures.

So unfair.  Just more candy in the candy store that is not real.
