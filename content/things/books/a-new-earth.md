title: A New Earth
subtitle: Eckhart Tolle 
image: /image/things/newearth.jpg
description: An amazing book on consciousness and your purpose.  Formalizes subjects mentioned in Eckhart's (ET ðŸ‘½) first book the Power of Now.  My goto read on public transit as the presence of his writing cuts through so much noise.
