<div class="card bg-default thing">
  <h4>Site Reliability / DevOps / Continuous Integration</h4>
  <p>
  The layers of site reliability is quite exciting to me ever since containerization started dominating.

  <a href="https://ansible.com">Ansible</a> with containers on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server">virtual private servers</a> is what I use but there are a plethora <i>platform as a service (PaaS)</i> like <a href="https://heroku.com">Heroku</a>.
  </p>

<div class="card bg-default thing">
  <h4>Cross Platform Mobile Frameworks</h4>
  <p><a href="https://reactnative.com">React Native</a>, <a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a> and <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/xamarin/">Xamarin</a> are most interesting to me.  It is a hard task to create the holy grail framework across products you have no control over, but they seem to do it pretty well.

<h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">Blockchain</a></h4>
<p>A secure decentralized tech for <a href="https://getmonero.org">alt-currency tech</a>, its quite amazing what netgineers have done with it.  Notably <a href="https://www.cryptokitties.co">cryptokitties</a> and for music artists <a href="https://ujomusic.com">Ujo</a>.</p>

<h4><a href="http://ipfs.org">Interplanetary File System</a></h4>
<p>Peer-to-peer for the web.  No more central servers dictating uptime. More security features.  Would be usefull to have your website live on after you pass. View on <a href="https://github.com/ipfs">github</a>.</p></div>

<div class="card bg-default thing">
<h4><a href="https://www.docker.com">Linux Containerization</a></h4>
<p>
These Linux kernel additions have proven very useful in the DevOps world, but also has a role to play in software development and testing.

</p>

<div class="card bg-default thing">
<h4><a href="http://reactivex.io">Reactive Extensions</a></h4>
<p>Interesting, misunderstood tech (not the javascript web framework). The short version goes like "Using the observable pattern on streams".  There is some <a href="https://youtu.be/looJcaeboBY">math behind it all</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="card bg-default thing">
<h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing">Fuzz Testing</a></h4>
<p>A penetration testing technique that turns out to be amazing at finding software bugs.  Notably, <a href="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl">AFL</a>, a project from a google employee with an impressive trophy case.</p>
</div>

<div class="card bg-default thing">
<h4><a href="http://www.phoenixframework.org">Phoenix Framework and Elixir/Erlang</a></h4>
<p>This promises to be a modern, ruby-like, easy to use web framework that delivers the scalability and stability of the erlang virtual machine.</p>
</div>

<div class="card bg-default thing">
<h4><a href="http://keybase.io">Keybase</a></h4>

<h4><a href="http://a.co/gKTJWhJ">A New Earth</a></h4>
