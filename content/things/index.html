<p>More pearls of wisdom, although its an older book, still pretty relevant.</p>

<p>This is originally an ancient (pre-christian) chinese text that loosely means "The way" however the nature of "Tao" is that it is unknown and cannot be translated.  The Stephen Mitchell translation was recommended for westerners by Eckhart Tolle.  I found the book very truthful and profound - each sentence needing to be absorbed so don't be afraid to look like it takes you an eternity to read a page!</p>

<p>Everytime I pick up this book, I only have to read a few pages before my reality is changed.</p>

<h2>Favourite Tech</2>

<hr>

<h4><a href="http://ipfs.org">Interplanetary File System</a></h4>
<p>Peer-to-peer for the web.  No more central servers dictating uptime. More security features.  View on <a href="https://github.com/ipfs">github</a>.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.docker.com">Docker and Containerization</a></h4>
<p>
While less secure than virtualization, it is good for testing on difference environments and simplifies builds/deployment.
</p>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/jimbojsb/launchrocket">Launch Rocket</a></h4>
<p>A mac preference pane that will scan your homebrew for services that be started/stopped (databases,docker,etc)</p>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/specialunderwear/Hosts.prefpane">Hosts Pref Pane</a></h4>
<p>Another preference pane that allows you to modify your hosts file.  I setup localhost versions of my domain names (localhost.coda.life)</p>

<h4><a href="http://nanomsg.org">Nanomsg and Scalability Protocols</a></h4>
<p>Scalable protocols for sockets, pretty interesting.</p>

<h4><a href="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/">American Fuzzy Lop and Fuzz Testing</a></h4>
<p>The surge of security patches over the last few years to several mainstay open-source projects are due to this project from a google employee.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.phoenixframework.org">Phoenix Framework and Elixir/Erlang</a></h4>
<p>This promises to be a modern, ruby-like, easy to use web framework that delivers the supreme scalability and stability of the erlang virtual machine.</p>

<h4><a href="http://keybase.io">Keybase and End-To-End Encryption</a></h4>
<p>A nice little solution for encrypting and managing keys.  Looks like some sort encrypted file system coming?  Its not quite an end-to-end provider but I feel like it could easily be used for an end-to-end solution</p>

<h4><a href="">Fender Stratocaster</a></h4>

<p>This bag is like a boredom-survival pouch that feels like a third arm.</p>
