<h2> Tech</h2>
<div class="card bg-default thing">
  <h4>Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning</h4>
  <p>
  An interesting area to be understandably excited about.  A bit unrealistic for a mostly unenlightened species dominated by a sociopath god called Money who has no remorse whatsoever.

  Data to feed these learning machines becomes more important than the algorithms.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="card bg-default thing">
  <h4>Site Reliability / Continuous Integration</h4>
  <p>
  The layers of site reliability is quite exciting to me ever since containerization started dominating.

  <a href="https://ansible.com">Ansible</a> with containers on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server">virtual private servers</a> is what I use but there are a plethora <i>platform as a service (PaaS)</i> like <a href="https://heroku.com">Heroku</a>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="card bg-default thing">
  <h4>Cross Platform Mobile Frameworks</h4>
  <p><a href="https://reactnative.com">React Native</a>, <a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a> and <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/xamarin/">Xamarin</a> are most interesting to me.  It is a hard task to create the holy grail framework across products you have no control over, but they seem to do it pretty well.

<div class="card bg-default thing">
<h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">Blockchain</a></h4>
<p>A secure decentralized tech for <a href="https://getmonero.org">alt-currency tech</a>, its quite amazing what netgineers have done with it.  Notably <a href="https://www.cryptokitties.co">cryptokitties</a> and for music artists <a href="https://ujomusic.com">Ujo</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="card bg-default thing">
<h4><a href="http://ipfs.org">Interplanetary File System</a></h4>
<p>Peer-to-peer for the web.  No more central servers dictating uptime. More security features.  Would be useful to have your website live on after you pass. View on <a href="https://github.com/ipfs">github</a>.</p></div>

<div class="card bg-default thing">
<h4><a href="https://www.docker.com">Linux Namespaces</a></h4>
<p>
The Linux <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_namespaces">namespace</a> additions to the kernel have proved very useful in a pseudo virtual machine like environment that trades the security of a virtual hardware layer for speed. Breeding *containerization* solutions like <a href="http://docker.com">Docker</a>, <a href="http://linuxcontainers.org">LXC</a>, and <a href="http://katacontainers.io">Kata Containers</a> (hybrid).
</p>
</div>

<div class="card bg-default thing">
<h4><a href="http://reactivex.io">Reactive Extensions</a></h4>
<p>Interesting, misunderstood tech (not the javascript web framework). The short version goes like "Using the observable pattern on streams".  There is some <a href="https://youtu.be/looJcaeboBY">math behind it all</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="card bg-default thing">
<h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing">Fuzz Testing</a></h4>
<p>A penetration testing technique that turns out to be amazing at finding software bugs.  Notably, <a href="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl">AFL</a>, a project from a google employee with an impressive trophy case.</p>
</div>

<div class="card bg-default thing">
<h4><a href="http://www.phoenixframework.org">Phoenix Framework and Elixir/Erlang</a></h4>
<p>This promises to be a modern, ruby-like, easy to use web framework that delivers the scalability and stability of the erlang virtual machine.</p>
</div>

<div class="card bg-default thing">
<h4><a href="http://keybase.io">Keybase</a></h4>
<p>A nice solution for managing encryption and keys.  Has a auto-encrypt file system and a chat client.</p>
</div>

  <h4><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/0735233144/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_DJUoFb3Q4JBM2">A Dream of Eagles</a></h4>
<img alt="A Dream of Eagles" src="/image/things/skystone.jpg" />
<p class="clearfix">
I love Roman history. The book is a great mix of King Arthur fiction and Roman non-fiction.  Written with an honourable style in a rite of passage epic.
</p>

<div class="card bg-default thing">
<h4><a href="http://a.co/gKTJWhJ">A New Earth</a></h4>
<img alt="A New Earth" src="/image/things/newearth.jpg" />
<p class="clearfix">An amazing book on consciousness and your purpose.  Formalizes subjects mentioned in Eckhart's first book the Power of Now.  My goto read on public transit as the presence of his writing cuts through so much noise.</p>

<h4><a href="http://a.co/4SznSAU">Tao Te Ching</a></h4>
<img alt="Tao Te Ting" src="/image/things/tao_te_ching.jpg" />
<p class="clearfix">An ancient Chinese text that loosely means "The Way" however the nature of "Tao" is that it is unknown and cannot be translated.  The Stephen Mitchell translation is recommended for westerners.</p>
</div>

<div class="card bg-default thing">
<h4><a href="http://a.co/2KwK0cz">Illusions: Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah</a></h4>
<img alt="Illusions: Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah" src="/image/things/illusions.jpg" />
<p class="clearfix">An interesting story, recommended by a few sources to me.  Popular in the old school UNIX and tech circles with the concept of reality as an illusion for learning and enjoyment.</p>
</div>

<div class="card bg-default thing">
<h4><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/rxjava-for-android-developers">RxJava for Android Developers</a></h4>
<img alt="RxJava for Android Developers" src="/image/things/rxjava_android.jpg" />
