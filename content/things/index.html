<h2> Tech</h2>

<p>You can check out <a href="https://github.com/ryjen?tab=stars">my starred repositories on github</a> but I'll highlight a few notable mentions here:</p>

<div class="well">
<h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">Blockchain</a></h4>
<p>Seems to be on everyone's radar a secure decentralized tech for <a href="https://getmonero.org">alt-currency tech</a>, its quite amazing what netgineers have done with it.  Notably <a href="https://www.cryptokitties.co">cryptokitties</a> and for music artists <a href="https://ujomusic.com">Ujo</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="well">
<h4><a href="http://ipfs.org">Interplanetary File System</a></h4>
<p>Peer-to-peer for the web.  No more central servers dictating uptime. More security features.  View on <a href="https://github.com/ipfs">github</a>.</p></div>

<div class="well">
<h4><a href="https://www.docker.com">Docker and Containerization</a></h4>
<p>
While less secure than virtualization, it is good for testing on difference environments and simplifies builds/deployment.
</p>
</div>

<div class="well">
<h4><a href="http://reactivex.io">Reactive Extensions</a></h4>
<p>Interesting, often misunderstood tech (its not a javascript web framework). There is some <a href="https://youtu.be/looJcaeboBY">solid match behind it all</a>.  The benfits include: <ul><li>reducing the amount of callback code you write and readability</li>
<li>a super glue in your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller">MVC</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–viewmodel">MVVM</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–presenter">MVVP</a> architecture for database/network to views.</li>
<li>Thread and stream synchronization. for example delays before parsing user input or sequential network calls</li></ul></p>
</div>

<div class="well">
<h4><a href="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/">American Fuzzy Lop and Fuzz Testing</a></h4>
<p>The surge of security patches over the last few years to several mainstay open-source projects are due to this project from a google employee.</p>
</div>

<div class="well">
<h4><a href="http://www.phoenixframework.org">Phoenix Framework and Elixir/Erlang</a></h4>
<p>This promises to be a modern, ruby-like, easy to use web framework that delivers the supreme scalability and stability of the erlang virtual machine.</p>
</div>

<div class="well">
<h4><a href="http://keybase.io">Keybase Encryption Provider</a></h4>
<p>A nice little solution for encrypting and managing keys.  Looks like some sort encrypted file system coming?  Its not quite an end-to-end provider but I feel like it could easily be used for an end-to-end solution</p>
</div>

<div class="well">
<h4><a href="https://github.com/jimbojsb/launchrocket">Launch Rocket</a></h4>
<p>A mac preference pane that will scan your homebrew for services that be started/stopped (databases,docker,etc)</p>
</div>

<div class="well">
<h4><a href="https://github.com/specialunderwear/Hosts.prefpane">Hosts Pref Pane</a></h4>
<p>Another preference pane that allows you to modify your hosts file.  I setup localhost versions of my domain names (localhost.coda.life)</p>
