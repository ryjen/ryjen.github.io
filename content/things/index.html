<h4><a href="http://ipfs.org">Interplanetary File System</a></h4>

<div class="well">
<h4><a href="https://www.docker.com">Docker and Containerization</a></h4>

While less secure than virtualization, it is good for testing on difference environments and simplifies builds/deployment.

<div class="well">
<h4><a href="http://nanomsg.org">Nanomsg and Scalability Protocols</a></h4>
<p>Scalable protocols for sockets, pretty interesting.</p>
</div>

<div class="well">
<h4><a href="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/">American Fuzzy Lop and Fuzz Testing</a></h4>
<p>The surge of security patches over the last few years to several mainstay open-source projects are due to this project from a google employee.</p>

<div class="well">
<h4><a href="http://keybase.io">Keybase Encryption Provider</a></h4>
<p>A nice little solution for encrypting and managing keys.  Looks like some sort encrypted file system coming?  Its not quite an end-to-end provider but I feel like it could easily be used for an end-to-end solution</p>
