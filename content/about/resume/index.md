<h1> Robert Ryan Jennings </h1>

<p>Entered software engineering at the bottom with embedded systems in 2007. The early days of mobile quickly became a niche.  Worked on many mobile platforms and languages, including Windows Mobile (PALM) (C++/C#), Windows Phone (C#), iOS (ObjC), Android and Blackberry (Java).  Have also worked in backend web development (JavaEE).</p>

<p>
Originally a hobbiest programmer and student of random internet developers since 2001. Pragmatism has been a guiding philosophy during education and professional life.  My other hobby is guitar where I can express myself in technique, theory, song writing and incorporating technology.
