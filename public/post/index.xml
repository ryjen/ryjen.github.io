Do not normally focus too much on the past, but it might be worth investigating for a source redemption from the conditions that negate me.
But if you cannot be bothered to read more than 500 characters about someone else, here is the TL;DR:
This is a moot point.

The underlying core of bitcoin, the blockchain is a system that can be applied to a variety of uses.
One particular disruptive use, that is not mentioned on the wiki, is mesh networks.
Like AI, nanotech or self driving cars, the technology has it&amp;rsquo;s criticisms of being advantageous to criminals (IMHO the lesser of evils).
Concept The idea and benefits are simple enough:</description></item><item><title>Software Methodologies</title><link>https://ryanjennin.gs/2020/08/20/software-methodologies/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/2020/08/20/software-methodologies/</guid><description>At the end of the day, software methodologies are all some form of Development Lifecycle.
That is to say, the individuals unit of work, the team&amp;rsquo;s unit of work and the business, are in one of several stages.
Requirements and Planning Analysis and Design Implementation Testing and Verification Deployment and Maintenance That is it. We all know it. The steps may vary but the core ones remain the same.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Schemaless Databases</title><link>https://ryanjennin.gs/2020/08/04/hybrid-schemaless-databases/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/2020/08/04/hybrid-schemaless-databases/</guid><description>TL;DR - Hydrid relational schemaless databases are quite awesome, with a little bit flowers in the garden.
True schemaless databases came into my radar with MongoDB, Redis and such. I have often admired the ability to alter schema on fly and enjoyed experimenting with the possibilities.
Enterprise solutions like Couchbase and Firebase have been big successes (even the now defunct Cparse).
Why? The success of schemaless databases makes a lot of sense in part because of API consumption of JSON and mobile devices if you can get the synchronization part right.</description></item><item><title>git notes as a storage mechanism</title><link>https://ryanjennin.gs/2020/06/25/git-notes-as-a-storage-mechanism/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/2020/06/25/git-notes-as-a-storage-mechanism/</guid><description>Am working on a project build tool to make repeatable tasks for Micrantha projects easier.
A module of this tool is automatic versioning using semantic version.
The versioning The way I wanted the versioning to work is to have thresholds for when a version component auto-increments.
For example:
A patch version will increment after 300 builds A minor version will increment after 100 patch builds This is a potential feature that projects can use as a reminder to bump a version if there are breaking changes.</description></item><item><title>12 Bar Blues</title><link>https://ryanjennin.gs/2019/10/02/12-bar-blues/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/2019/10/02/12-bar-blues/</guid><description>You might have heard of the blues, made famous as a way to make a living in the US for marginalized citizens.
The story goes that the French taught the Black community music theory and unlocked a creative juice thirsting for expression.
12 bar blues is very basic music lesson and is known universally by musicians as a way to quickly join other musicians musically.
Scales: a quick primer ðŸŽ¼ The most common western scale - the major scale - has 7 notes representing pitch.</description></item><item><title>Mirroring git with jenkins</title><link>https://ryanjennin.gs/2019/07/05/mirroring-git-with-jenkins/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/2019/07/05/mirroring-git-with-jenkins/</guid><description>Introduction For some software development projects, there may be a need to backup or mirror the repository to a different location.
Jenkins or other continuous integration (CI) can automate this. This log is a brief summary of how in case I need to reproduce.
Workflow The requirement is to have a single jenkins job that synchronizes various other projects and repositories.
To do this, the job calls another job to mirror any source repository to any set of destination repositories.</description></item><item><title>A self hosting journey</title><link>https://ryanjennin.gs/2019/02/07/a-self-hosting-journey/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/2019/02/07/a-self-hosting-journey/</guid><description>Introduction Would like to say that I have valid privacy or security concerns. Or because it can be done better. But the reality is, I just want to self host because I can.
Where to start? The awesome self hosted page lists just about every cloud service I use with a replaceable near-quality solution, if your willing to sacrifice a bit for it.
The other appealing factor is that most of the solutions can be containerized and reproducible across servers - meaning more availability.</description></item><item><title>Favourite 'nixisms</title><link>https://ryanjennin.gs/2018/11/05/favourite-nixisms/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/2018/11/05/favourite-nixisms/</guid><description>Introduction A log to myself of things I like about Unix type systems. In case I forget why someday.
Dotfiles files in braille? are they for the blind?Dotfiles in Linux are hidden files preceded with a period. Depending on the program, they are used for configuration in your home directory.
It is common to have a set of dotfiles that you use regularly on different computer systems.
There are many ways and tools to manage your dotfiles.</description></item><item><title>Mitmproxy and Android</title><link>https://ryanjennin.gs/2018/05/16/mitmproxy-and-android/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/2018/05/16/mitmproxy-and-android/</guid><description>Introduction Debugging network traffic for your app can be useful, and sometimes necessary if the data is not what is expected or inconsistent.
The Proxy I prefer the open source proxy [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org =300x203). Easy to install on OSX with homebrew.
brew install mitmproxy
I&amp;rsquo;ll leave it up to you to explore its greatness, I just wanna clarify the android setup.
Steps 1) mitmproxy Choose a port (ex. 8888) and start the program: mitmproxy -p 8888:</description></item><item><title>Fortunes on Slack</title><link>https://ryanjennin.gs/2018/01/22/fortunes-on-slack/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/2018/01/22/fortunes-on-slack/</guid><description>view the service homepage
Introduction Have always enjoyed the UNIX fortunes program, ever since I was a wee newbie. If you aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with it (sad), yes, its like a fortune cookie.
It can be more technical in nature but not always. It also has poems, quotations, and if enabled - offensive content.
Often I would find a fortune I&amp;rsquo;d like to share and pipe it to a snippet from the terminal.</description></item><item><title>Elixir and Phoenix</title><link>https://ryanjennin.gs/2015/09/09/elixir-and-phoenix/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/2015/09/09/elixir-and-phoenix/</guid><description>Introduction If you dont know phoenix framework, I&amp;rsquo;d describe it as rails for elixir. If you dont know Elixir I&amp;rsquo;d describe it as a functional language that feels like ruby for erlang.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t know erlang it has been around a while (open-sourced in 1998) and the virtual machine is designed to be highly fault tolerant and scalable for use in telecoms, banking and instant messaging (WhatsApp).
