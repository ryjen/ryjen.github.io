      <description>At the end of the day, software methodologies are all some form of Development Lifecycle.
That is to say, the individuals unit of work, the team&amp;rsquo;s unit of work and the business, are in one of several stages.
 Requirements and Planning Analysis and Design Implementation Testing and Verification Deployment and Maintenance  That is it. We all know it. The steps may vary but the core ones remain the same.</description>

      <title>Poems of Form and Duality</title>

      <description>Take it for what you want. There is ultimately very little meaning to life, we only try to find some in the suffering. Perhaps my meaning is to express it in art form. Love Poem Love is at the mercy of form,
Without, may as not be real.
Form is merciless,
At its peak and as it degrades.  Love is a chemical delusion,
That is dependent on others,</description>

      <title>Hybrid Schemaless Databases</title>

      <description>TL;DR - Hydrid relational schemaless databases are quite awesome, with a little bit flowers in the garden.
True schemaless databases came into my radar with MongoDB, Redis and such. I have often admired the ability to alter schema on fly and enjoyed experimenting with the possibilities.
Enterprise solutions like Couchbase and Firebase have been big successes (even the now defunct Cparse).
Why? The success of schemaless databases makes a lot of sense in part because of API consumption of JSON and mobile devices if you can get the synchronization part right.</description>

      <description>Remembering a concept from the book Sapiens (paraphrasing):
 Ape hierarchy only existed in small groups with a limit (150 or so) with a dominant leader (alpha). This applies to humans as well, but we were able so surpass the threshold with myths and better communication.
 And the definition of ego by ET ðŸ‘½:
 A complete and total identification with form as who you are - a thought form or a physical form.</description>

      <title>git notes as a storage mechanism</title>

      <description>Am working on a project build tool to make repeatable tasks for Micrantha projects easier.
A module of this tool is automatic versioning using semantic version.
The versioning The way I wanted the versioning to work is to have thresholds for when a version component auto-increments.
For example:
 A patch version will increment after 300 builds A minor version will increment after 100 patch builds  This is a potential feature that projects can use as a reminder to bump a version if there are breaking changes.</description>

      <description>You might have heard of the blues, made famous as a way to make a living in the US for marginalized citizens.
The story goes that the French taught the Black community music theory and unlocked a creative juice thirsting for expression.
12 bar blues is very basic music lesson and is known universally by musicians as a way to quickly join other musicians musically.
Scales: a quick primer ðŸŽ¼ The most common western scale - the major scale - has 7 notes representing pitch.</description>

      <title>Mirroring git with jenkins</title>

      <description>Introduction For some software development projects, there may be a need to backup or mirror the repository to a different location.
Jenkins or other continuous integration (CI) can automate this. This log is a brief summary of how in case I need to reproduce.
Workflow The requirement is to have a single jenkins job that synchronizes various other projects and repositories.
To do this, the job calls another job to mirror any source repository to any set of destination repositories.</description>

      <title>A self hosting journey</title>

      <description>Introduction Would like to say that I have valid privacy or security concerns. Or because it can be done better. But the reality is, I just want to self host because I can.
Where to start? The awesome self hosted page lists just about every cloud service I use with a replaceable near-quality solution, if your willing to sacrifice a bit for it.
The other appealing factor is that most of the solutions can be containerized and reproducible across servers - meaning more availability.</description>

      <description>Major Lessons Eckhart Tolle or ET is a unique individual, author and orator. After a suicidal night where he thought &amp;ldquo;I cannot live with myself any longer&amp;rdquo; and recognized the oddity of thought, as if there were two people &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;myself&amp;rdquo;. That recognition brought a radical inner transformation and years of intense bliss. He later learned more about what happened to him and became a &amp;ldquo;spiritual teacher&amp;rdquo;.
His books The Power of Now and A New Earth have been #1 on the New York Times best seller list.</description>

      <description>Introduction A log to myself of things I like about Unix type systems. In case I forget why someday.
Dotfiles files in braille? are they for the blind?Dotfiles in Linux are hidden files preceded with a period. Depending on the program, they are used for configuration in your home directory.
It is common to have a set of dotfiles that you use regularly on different computer systems.
There are many ways and tools to manage your dotfiles.</description>

      <description>Introduction Debugging network traffic for your app can be useful, and sometimes necessary if the data is not what is expected or inconsistent.
The Proxy I prefer the open source proxy [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org =300x203). Easy to install on OSX with homebrew.
brew install mitmproxy
I&amp;rsquo;ll leave it up to you to explore its greatness, I just wanna clarify the android setup.
Steps 1) mitmproxy Choose a port (ex. 8888) and start the program: mitmproxy -p 8888:</description>

      <description>view the service homepage
Introduction Have always enjoyed the UNIX fortunes program, ever since I was a wee newbie. If you aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with it (sad), yes, its like a fortune cookie.
It can be more technical in nature but not always. It also has poems, quotations, and if enabled - offensive content.
Often I would find a fortune I&amp;rsquo;d like to share and pipe it to a snippet from the terminal.</description>

      <description>Introduction If you dont know phoenix framework, I&amp;rsquo;d describe it as rails for elixir. If you dont know Elixir I&amp;rsquo;d describe it as a functional language that feels like ruby for erlang.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t know erlang it has been around a while (open-sourced in 1998) and the virtual machine is designed to be highly fault tolerant and scalable for use in telecoms, banking and instant messaging (WhatsApp).
Experimenting To exercise the framework, I created yet another chat app (I know, I know).</description>

      <guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/2012/11/17/crafting-a-game-with-craftyjs/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Briefly going to mention a javascript game engine called CraftyJS that I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with the past couple of days.
Has the usual suspects like Entity Component System, Collision, Sprite Maps, etc.
The Project 
Amos the Alien is a small demo I made.
I knew that I wanted a scrolling background of some sort - in other words - parallax scrolling. I also knew that I wanted two modes of scrolling: A) automatic background scrollin (clouds, etc) and character movement scrolling.</description>

      <title>C Sqlite Tricks</title>

      <guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/2012/05/15/c-sqlite-tricks/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Thought I would share some tricks I use for easy data CRUD&amp;rsquo;s in C. I&amp;rsquo;m using Sqlite here, but could apply to any database.
Not saying its the best approach at all (nor ryjen/db), this is just how it evolved for me.
Mapping The core of my data access is the FieldMap structure, which determines how to save each field to the database.
/* * this is the magical table used to communicate between memory and the database */ typedef struct FieldMap { const char *name; /* name of the field */ void *value; /* a pointer to the value of the field */ int type; /* type of value */ const void *arg1; /* additional argument */ const void *arg2; /* additional argument */ int flags; /* usage flags */ } FieldMap; /* callback for custom field types */ typedef int (*CustomField) (sqlite3_stmt *, int column, FieldMap *field); typedef void (*DbCallback) (sqlite3_stmt *); Basically you would have to:Example 1 - Saving This high level example shows building a quick table for each field we want to save in the database.</description>
