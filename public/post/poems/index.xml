      <description>I watch them beat you,
Watch them beat you down.
There is nothing I can do,
Brother, just like you.
So when things go wrong,
Go wrong with you,
It hurts me too.
 They say you know,
You know what to do.
It is so common,
So common its true.
Because things cant go wrong,
Go wrong with you,
It is so untrue.
 I watch them steal,
Your whole life away.</description>
