      <description>Introduction Would like to say that I have valid privacy or security concerns. Or because it can be done better. But the reality is, I just want to self host because I can.
Where to start? The awesome self hosted page lists just about every cloud service I use with a replaceable near-quality solution, if your willing to sacrifice a bit for it.
The other appealing factor is that most of the solutions can be containerized and reproducible across servers - meaning more availability.</description>

Introduction Have always enjoyed the UNIX fortunes program, ever since I was a wee newbie. If you aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with it (sad), yes, its like a fortune cookie.
It can be more technical in nature but not always. It also has poems, quotations, and if enabled - offensive content.
Often I would find a fortune I&amp;rsquo;d like to share and pipe it to a snippet from the terminal.</description>
