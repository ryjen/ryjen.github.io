      <description>Found out that C structs can be casted between each other if the field types and ordering are the same. It is not portable code, but you can start too see how and why the virtual table and object oriented programming evolved in c++.
As far as I know it would still be possible to write this in c++, but as always, you should definitely not.
A Quick Example struct Animal { int eyes; } struct Dog { int eyes; /* dog specific */ int tail; } struct Human{ int eyes; /* human specific */ int brain; }  Passing humans or dogs to any function that takes an animal with a cast.</description>

      <title>C Sqlite Tricks</title>

      <description>Introduction Thought I would share some tricks I use for easy data CRUD&amp;rsquo;s in C. I&amp;rsquo;m using Sqlite here, but could apply to any database.
Not saying its the best approach at all (nor ryjen/db), this is just how it evolved for me.
Mapping The core of my data access is the FieldMap structure, which determines how to save each field to the database.
/* * this is the magical table used to communicate between memory and the database */ typedef struct FieldMap { const char *name; /* name of the field */ void *value; /* a pointer to the value of the field */ int type; /* type of value */ const void *arg1; /* additional argument */ const void *arg2; /* additional argument */ int flags; /* usage flags */ } FieldMap; /* callback for custom field types */ typedef int (*CustomField) (sqlite3_stmt *, int column, FieldMap *field); typedef void (*DbCallback) (sqlite3_stmt *);  Note: these examples will create this table dynamically with an object, however this can be used as a static table.</description>
