      <description>Yes, rubber duck debugging is really funny.
The wiki, a dedicated site or coding horror explain it pretty well.
It is a fantastic methodology because there is no other human to try and take advantage of your stupidity - implicitly (unconsciously) or explicitly (capitalism).
Like media and technology which this world unconsciously loves and wants to be&amp;hellip;. There is a shadow side.
To me the story says something about doing programming in the bathtub with a computer.</description>
