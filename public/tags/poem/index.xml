      <description>Love Poem Love is at the mercy of form,
Without, may as not be real.
Form is merciless,
At its peak and as it degrades.  Love is a chemical delusion,
That is dependent on others,
To keep the chemicals flowing.  Love is loyalty and trust,
Devotion and passion.
Skewed by lack,
And absenteeism in,
A complex world.  Love is a great tree,
Of family and positivity,</description>
