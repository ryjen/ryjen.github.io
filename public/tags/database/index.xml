Schemaless databases came into my radar with MongoDB, Redis and such. I have often admired the ability to alter schema on fly and enjoyed experimenting with the possibilities.
Solutions like the now defunct cparse, couchbase and Firebase have been big successes.
Why? The success of schemaless databases makes a lot of sense in part because of API consumption as JSON and mobile devices if you can get the synchronization part right.</description></item></channel></rss>
