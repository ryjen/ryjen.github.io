      <description>After some discussions earlier today regarding legality, countries and the internet, had to jot down some thoughts.
The rule of law for governing works at different levels.
Am sure you are aware how globalization and the internet have exposed how difficult it is for countries to integrate with each other without some sort of super world organization governing that.
It becomes so apparent that a super world governing organization is not only extremely risky and difficult, it is undesirable given any current governments performance in the world.</description>

      <description>Something really positive about covid-19&amp;hellip;
Is something that drives me wild with love üòç and passion üòò
I am talking about the little extra plumpness to Canadian news anchors.
OMG, I am going to pleasantly die with desire üòà.
Am talking about you Vassy Kapelos and Rosemary Barton.
MMMMMMMMM can I suck on your necks and kiss everything?
Also a big fan of Adrienne Arsenault. Can I get a date??</description>

      <title>Opinion Wall</title>

      <description>Opinions are also like onions. They can make others cry, or your &amp;ldquo;self&amp;rdquo; when it gets all wrapped in as who you are.
  Given the atomic bomb of the &amp;ldquo;pill&amp;rdquo;, I think professional sex workers are less expensive than wives and with less drama. But I do not trust Pimps or the Porn industry to regulate health. I want Health Canada to step in.
  #MeToo and Feminism has devolved into reverse chauvinism.</description>

      <guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/musings/questioning-the-suffering/</guid>
      <description>Do you feel entitled to be a victim of someone or something else?
Do you think your mind or the situation generates more suffering?
Do you think that you deserve better? That you are overlooked?
That your perception of reality is absolute?
That you might physically die if you are not what you think?
Do people take advantage of your suffering? Or challenge it?
Is your suffering physical, mental or both?</description>

      <description>To belong in the world
One must display a belief
In of love
Without risk
 To belong in the world
One must display
Kindness and responsibility
Being the bringer of life.
 To belong in this world
One must display
Total confidence
and denial of failure.
 To belong in this world
One must display
A positive mind
And forgive your self when not.
Hoorah hoorah, you now belong in the world.</description>

      <description>Winners and Losers. All of us have probably felt this is true in some level.
Its true with men, and the various games in the lives of the different hues of man.
Have not read Trumpian literature on the subject but do have my own opinion that is somewhat biased to the loser side.
Starting with the most noisy:
Winners In the winner realm there are other dualities that signify their deserving of winning.</description>

      <title>Covac</title>

      <description>Am very glad a covid vaccine has a real chance.
&amp;ldquo;Little bottle of hope&amp;rdquo; for saving humans and creating prosperity for more.
That being said, I am actually very bitter going back to the new-normal, with a lot of skepticism.
Seed of the Lemon The root of my problem is that the new-normal is just the old-abnormal and that pre-covid life was not that great anyway.
We were always already living on the edge of collapse: environmental, economic, war, societal, or technological.</description>

      <title>The Dreams</title>

      <guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/musings/the-dream/</guid>
      <description>Life is a like a dream, a background awareness of reality.‚Ä¶. as a nightmare at worst and a delusion at best. You can guide your self down the stream, but you do not know where you are going and you cannot go back.
 Caught somewhere in between the trickle of survival, getting ahead, a social life, and a personal life - the dream of solid ground seems a myth.</description>

      <description>Politics. Does it matter? Why?
It is great that the human condition is suffering, as there is a plethora of issues to take unconscious action on.
When it comes down to actionable issues that are most common, it is always children.
Save the puppies first and foremost. It all kind of bubbles up to that.
Real change like saving the environment, technology, inequality, transcending the ego or peace always has an undesired effect that conflicts with the puppies.</description>

      <title>Artist, Art tisk</title>

      <description>The wikipedia on art in the 21st century is hilariously lacking.
Curious how distracted it all feels, rebounding in trauma from the constant suffering and crises.
There are some great artists who get overlooked compared to economics, disasters, in-equality or technology. The art itself is reflected by that merely resembles pornography or violence.
Art delivery has a digital / non-digital divide that correlates with the 21st century.
The first 20 years have been a digital revolution.</description>

      <description>Hello, World Trying to find at least zero motivation for the tech industry instead of negative infinity.
Do not normally focus too much on the past, in fact I tend to block out most of the bad parts.
But it might be worth investigating for a source redemption from the conditions that negate me.
But if you cannot be bothered to read more than 500 characters about someone else, here is the TL;DR:</description>

      <title>The Dead Triplets</title>

      <description>This post could about music theory and rhythm, such as the triplet guitar riffs in invincible&amp;hellip;
But this about a single chapter, in a single book from the swamp. It is probably already a more influential book than I realize, from which I quote liberally and implicitly.
As monks say, the soul is wet (thus presumably messy) and a dry soul is lacking life.

      <title>Poems of Form and Duality</title>
      <link>https://ryanjennin.gs/musings/poems-of-duality-and-form/</link>

      <description>Love Poem Love is at the mercy of form,
Without, may as not be real.
Form is merciless,
At its peak and as it degrades.  Love is a chemical delusion,
That is dependent on others,
To keep the chemicals flowing.  Love is loyalty and trust,
Devotion and passion.
Skewed by lack,
And absenteeism in,
A complex world.  Love is a great tree,
Of family and positivity,</description>

      <description>Remembering a concept from the book Sapiens (paraphrasing):
 Ape hierarchy only existed in small groups with a limit (150 or so) with a dominant leader (alpha). This applies to humans as well, but we were able so surpass the threshold with myths and better communication.
 And the definition of ego by ET üëΩ:
 A complete and total identification with form as who you are - a thought form or a physical form.</description>

      <description>You might have heard of the blues, made famous as a way to make a living in the US for marginalized citizens.
The story goes that the French taught the Black community music theory and unlocked a creative juice thirsting for expression.
12 bar blues is very basic music lesson and is known universally by musicians as a way to quickly join other musicians musically.
Scales: a quick primer üéº The most common western scale - the major scale - has 7 notes representing pitch.</description>

      <title>What I&#39;ve Learned from 4 Years of Eckhart Tolle</title>
      <link>https://ryanjennin.gs/musings/what-ive-learned-from-ekchart-tolle/</link>

      <description>Major Lessons Eckhart Tolle or ET is a unique individual, author and orator. After a suicidal night where he thought &amp;ldquo;I cannot live with myself any longer&amp;rdquo; and recognized the oddity of thought, as if there were two people &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;myself&amp;rdquo;. That recognition brought a radical inner transformation and years of intense bliss. He later learned more about what happened to him and became a &amp;ldquo;spiritual teacher&amp;rdquo;.
His books The Power of Now and A New Earth have been #1 on the New York Times best seller list.</description>
