As such, is capable of wreaking havoc that any planetary being would not normally do.</p><p>We have a limited number of resources on our Earth space ship and we must stop the bullshit, take stock of what we have left, allocate and plan accordingly.</p><p>Obviously, I am not sure how this would solve any drama with limited resources, and still requires governance, but maybe that is not the point.</p><p>In fact, my final opinion on the Venus Project is that the monetary world can still exist at a country level for the ego kids to play in. But not at the world organization level.</p><p>I know how flaky it sounds, like environmentalists trying to avoid turning Earth into an uninhabitable Venus. But honestly, I don&rsquo;t see a more logical approach.</p><h2 id=taxing-countries>Taxing Countries</h2><p>We have already starting taxing countries that opt-in to environmental treaties, but they have not been very successful in my opinion because you have to balance the survival of the puppies and the families.</p><p>Lets take that hit tune or jab from the Imperial Trumpist Quartet called &ldquo;Tax China for Covid-19&rdquo;.</p><p>Pretty moronic taxing for something unintentional, but it got me thinking about some of the things I would tax America for.</p><h3 id=the-petition-a-sample-flyer>The Petition: A Sample Flyer</h3><p>Do you live in a culture of Envy & Ego (the word ego is misunderstood and overused, but do not know how else to describe it).</p><p>Did you report your college sexual assault in a monotone voice? Were the confident Alpha-Beta boys not satisfied with pornography and have their way with you?</p><p>Did your religion get reduced to a bunch of TV infomercial fanatics, bigotry, dogmatism, chauvinism and frankly, insanity?</p><p>Are you tired of greed being protected by legalese and inequality?</p><p>Do you suffer existing in avoidance of all those great fucking cars and their infrastructure, even though you do so for safety of body and mind?</p><p>Do you feel deeply offended by the Imperial Trumpist Quartet&rsquo;s tune or their backlash such as #blm and #metoo? (Is a fish privileged if it only knows living in water?)</p><p>Are you tired of the good guy fight that keeps fucking you in the arse like a piece of shit because he is so much better than you?</p><p>Are you tired of feeling like you are alone in a connected world because people are too fucking brainwashed with a shit culture you cannot relate to them?</p><p>Are you tired of of the mad cows and environment cost of eating hormone fueled, chemicalized sugar shit produced in mass cruelty and insanity just for the luxury of it?</p><p>Are you tired of wasting time not dealing with real problems?</p><p><strong>Lets Tax America For It.</strong></p></div></div></div><hr><div class=container></div></div><div id=footer><script data-goatcounter=https://analytics.micrantha.com/count async src=//analytics.micrantha.com/count.js></script><button id=themer class=center type=button>enlighten</button><div class="menu center"><ul><li><a href=mailto:robert@ryanjennin.gs aria-label=email><i class="fa-3x fas fa-envelope"></i></a></li><li><a href=https://micrantha.com aria-label=biz><i class="fa-3x fas fa-building"></i></a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/ryjen aria-label=github><i class="fa-3x fab fa-github"></i></a></li><li><a href=https://linkedin.com/in/ryjen aria-label=linkedin><i class="fa-3x fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li></ul></div><div class=center>Â© all rights reserved, ryan jennings</div></div><script src=/js/vendor.min.js defer></script><script src=/js/theme.min.js defer></script><script src=/js/app.min.js defer></script><script data-goatcounter=https://analytics.micrantha.com/count async src=//analytics.micrantha.com/count.js></script></body></html>
