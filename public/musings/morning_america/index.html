    <div class="text-justify"><p>Winners and Losers.  All of us have probably felt this is true in some level.</p>
<p>Its true with men, and the various games in the lives of the different hues of man.</p>
<p>Have not read Trumpian literature on the subject but do have my own opinion that is somewhat biased to the loser side.</p>
<p>Starting with the most noisy:</p>
<h2 id="winners">Winners</h2>
<p>In the winner realm there are other dualities that signify their deserving of winning.</p>
<p>Good and evil - winners are good, and people trying to take winning from them are evil.</p>
<p>Winners bring the light to the loser darkness.</p>
<p>In a human being, winners are the human.</p>
<p>The winner weapon of choice in the duality wars is positivity.</p>
<p>Positivity masks reality and their own natural human condition.</p>
<p>Winners dump negativity in the loser realm if they cannot vanquish it.</p>
<p>They are incapable of recognizing their own suffering as not external, through the positivity mask (or chemicals).</p>
<h2 id="losers">Losers</h2>
<p>In the loser realm the winners represent an extremist form of suffering.</p>
<p>In a human being, losers are the being (not taking a hue of man).</p>
<p>The attachment to positivity in the mother complex can delay enlightenment from the winner realm.  Sometimes for an entire lifetime.</p>
<p>An unenlightened loser has other dualities to signify their victim hood. Such as unconscious vs conscious, suffering vs enlightenment, oppression vs liberation.</p>
<p>A semi-enlightened loser knows that the belief of light in the winner realm creates shadow - but is still more comfortable inside it.</p>
<p>An enlightened loser knows that there is ultimately no winner loser duality, but are forced to participate.</p>
<h2 id="insights">Insights</h2>
<p>The next-gen of America in the power transfer will be to a loser a next-gen of things to miss out on.</p>
<p>America is black and has soul. We will be missing out on that to which they are happy to export, which is fine, except for one thing.</p>
<p>I walk amongst the winning zombies in loserville, all selling me something I am missing out on.  Selling me America.  Selling me false hope, or hope with a loss, hope on something to miss out on.</p>
<p>I see the drug overdoses and the poverty and I look at the history of heroin.  How the British capitalized on China with heroin and think &ldquo;Yah, If I was asian or south asian, I would want heroin revenge for the British Columbia&rdquo;</p>
<p>I look at the pandemic struggles and how the winners suffer and how the losers enjoy it and my socialist tendencies think &ldquo;Yah, that is correct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I look at social lives of others and see that everyone is trying extremely hard to be a winner to get revenge.  Or being so distraught by people who&rsquo;s circumstances are just right to fit the cookie-cutter.  Or following a pattern that makes them as stupid as possible and giving up as much data as possible.</p>
<p>I look at the winners seeping into the internet and the tech bubble in my lifetime and think &ldquo;well, that was a waste&rdquo;.</p>
<p>My old victimage says to me, Canada is a loser, America is a winner, and nobody is waking up from it.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, we are just the &lsquo;Mericas and I have no idea who Mexico is or why countries still exist in a inter-connected planet that is dying from such collective competition.</p>
