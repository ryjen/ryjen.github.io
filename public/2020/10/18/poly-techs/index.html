Does it matter? Why?</p><p>It is great that the <strong>human condition is suffering</strong>, as there is a plethora of issues to take unconscious action on.</p><p>When it comes down to actionable issues that are most common, it is always <strong>children</strong>.</p><p><strong>Save the puppies</strong> first and foremost. It all kind of bubbles up to that.</p><p><strong>Real change</strong> like saving the environment, technology, inequality, transcending the ego or peace always has an undesired effect that conflicts with the puppies.</p><p>Great politician&rsquo;s know that <em>if you save enough puppies, you might have enough power to make the necessary disruptive changes</em>.</p><p>Given the <em>short term nature of service</em>, it destiny to fail. Once the <em>real change</em> is implemented, you lose power, or the <em>economics</em> were a problem.</p><p>Such was the <strong>golden era of baby boomers</strong> who&rsquo;s mass accumulated enough give power to change. And also their failure for not making enough. Good thing Trudy has a last kick at the can while he could eh? It seemed to me his unpopular policies were only to build an economic war chest for <strong>real change</strong>.</p><h2 id=the-canadian-parties>The Canadian Parties</h2><p>So for what it is worth, this is my view:</p><h3 id=liberals>Liberals</h3><p>Boomer ignorance town, whatever goes, as long as there is economics and power.</p><p>They will cultivate biases of oppression, intolerance and people not in touch with reality to get power.</p><h3 id=conservatives>Conservatives</h3><p>Really good accountants and perfect for government, but a too weird on the religion and intolerance.</p><p>They will cultivate biases of instability, irresponsibility, insecure and a lack of safety to obtain power.</p><h3 id=ndp>NDP</h3><p>The socialist alternative, will balance saving the puppies with real issues, but always lack lasting power</p><p>They will cultivate biases of a lack of caring, and injustice to obtain power.</p><h3 id=green>Green</h3><p>The environment alternative, your puppies are better in the long run, but nobody has time for it.</p><p>They will cultivate biases of corporate ignorance.</p><h3 id=rhino-partyhttpswwwpartyrhinocaen><a href=https://www.partyrhino.ca/en/>Rhino Party</a></h3><p>A joke party, with hilarious agendas that make fun of real ones. And they are <strong>horny</strong>!</p><p>They will cultivate biases of the irrelevance of politics.</p><h2 id=single-people>Single People</h2><p>In acceptance with my current life circumstances, my main grief is that <strong>single people</strong> need some help.</p><p>Am not talking about <em>child support</em> in <em>broken co-dependent relationships</em></p><p>Why should only one income have more difficulty <em>financially</em> or finding a place to live? With or without children.</p><p>The average person lives, what, 80 years more or less hard labour? With no hope for parole.</p><p>How much <em>pollution</em> do think that person produces in this society in time?</p><p>How many <em>resources</em> does that person requires, 3 meals a day, etc?</p><p>How much <em>space</em> does that person require to be <strong>free</strong>?</p><p>How much <em>money</em> does that person require to live that long?</p><p>How much suffering does that person feel themselves or cause to others in that time?</p><p>Politicians should <strong>add up that cost</strong> and give that to me in a <strong>tax break</strong> instead.</p><p>Why should only the non-upper class families get the extra relief?</p><p>Yes, I suppose I just feel cut off from any reality that would support <strong>baby RJ</strong>.</p><p>A female polarity would show me the light, but I think society threw my rib away, trying to get theirs.</p></div></div></div><hr><div class=container><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=application/javascript>var disqus_config=function(){};(function(){if(["localhost","127.0.0.1"].indexOf(window.location.hostname)!=-1){document.getElementById('disqus_thread').innerHTML='Disqus comments not available by default when the website is previewed locally.';return;}
