      <description>After some discussions earlier today regarding legality, countries and the internet, had to jot down some thoughts.
The rule of law for governing works at different levels.
Am sure you are aware how globalization and the internet have exposed how difficult it is for countries to integrate with each other without some sort of super world organization governing that.</description>

      <description>Something really positive about covid-19&amp;hellip;
Is something that drives me wild with love üòç and passion üòò
I am talking about the little extra plumpness to Canadian news anchors.
OMG, I am going to pleasantly die with desire üòà.
Am talking about you Vassy Kapelos and Rosemary Barton.</description>

      <description>Do you ever notice that whenever humanity gets squeezed, our worst selves make the most noise?
The mental-emotional state of the human condition, acting like a virus. And we indirectly like to think we are a part of something.
All the pandemic, racism, sexism, and inequality is hugely symptomatic of suffering and the mind run amok in resistance.</description>

      <description>Who are you? Who am I?
Are you a body?
Are you a thought?
Are you more than a pin point in time?
If your body degenerates, are you still your body?
If your thought changes, are you still your thought?</description>

      <title>Killing the Pain</title>

      <description>Pain is the only lens from which I can view the software industry.
&amp;ldquo;Killing&amp;rdquo; is such a sales word, but its what I want to do to it.
Normally, a level of unsatisfaction would be OK - its just a job.</description>

      <description>Opinions are also like onions. They can make others cry, or your &amp;ldquo;self&amp;rdquo; when it gets all wrapped in as who you are.
  Given the atomic bomb of the &amp;ldquo;pill&amp;rdquo;, I think professional sex workers are less expensive than wives and with less drama.</description>

      <guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/verbage/musings/questioning-the-suffering/</guid>
      <description>Do you feel entitled to be a victim of someone or something else?
Do you think your mind or the situation generates more suffering?
Do you think that you deserve better? That you are overlooked?
That your perception of reality is absolute?</description>

      <description>To belong in the world
One must display a belief
In of love
Without risk
 To belong in the world
One must display
Kindness and responsibility
Being the bringer of life.
 To belong in this world

      <description>Winners and Losers. All of us have probably felt this is true in some level.
Its true with men, and the various games in the lives of the different hues of man.
Have not read Trumpian literature on the subject but do have my own opinion that is somewhat biased to the loser side.</description>

      <description>Am very glad a covid vaccine has a real chance.
&amp;ldquo;Little bottle of hope&amp;rdquo; for saving humans and creating prosperity for more.
That being said, I am actually very bitter going back to the new-normal, with a lot of skepticism.</description>

      <description>Life is a like a dream, a background awareness of reality.‚Ä¶. as a nightmare at worst and a delusion at best. You can guide your self down the stream, but you do not know where you are going and you cannot go back.</description>

      <description>Politics. Does it matter? Why?
It is great that the human condition is suffering, as there is a plethora of issues to take unconscious action on.
When it comes down to actionable issues that are most common, it is always children.</description>

      <title>Artist, Art tisk</title>

      <description>The wikipedia on art in the 21st century is hilariously lacking.
Curious how distracted it all feels, rebounding in trauma from the constant suffering and crises.
There are some great artists who get overlooked compared to economics, disasters, in-equality or technology.</description>

      <description>Hello, World Trying to find at least zero motivation for the tech industry instead of negative infinity.
Do not normally focus too much on the past, in fact I tend to block out most of the bad parts.
But it might be worth investigating for a source redemption from the conditions that negate me.</description>

      <title>The Dead Triplets</title>

      <description>This post could about music theory and rhythm, such as the triplet guitar riffs in invincible&amp;hellip;
But this about a single chapter, in a single book from the swamp. It is probably already a more influential book than I realize, from which I quote liberally and implicitly.</description>

      <title>Poems of Form and Duality</title>
      <link>https://ryanjennin.gs/verbage/musings/poems-of-duality-and-form/</link>

      <guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/verbage/musings/poems-of-duality-and-form/</guid>
      <description>Love Poem Love is at the mercy of form,
Without, may as not be real.
Form is merciless,
At its peak and as it degrades.  Love is a chemical delusion,
That is dependent on others,
To keep the chemicals flowing.</description>

      <title>Myths Fading, Direction of Evolution</title>

      <description>Remembering a concept from the book Sapiens (paraphrasing):
 Ape hierarchy only existed in small groups with a limit (150 or so) with a dominant leader (alpha). This applies to humans as well, but we were able so surpass the threshold with myths and better communication.</description>

      <description>You might have heard of the blues, made famous as a way to make a living in the US for marginalized citizens.
The story goes that the French taught the Black community music theory and unlocked a creative juice thirsting for expression.</description>

      <description>Major Lessons Eckhart Tolle or ET is a unique individual, author and orator. After a suicidal night where he thought &amp;ldquo;I cannot live with myself any longer&amp;rdquo; and recognized the oddity of thought, as if there were two people &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;myself&amp;rdquo;.</description>
