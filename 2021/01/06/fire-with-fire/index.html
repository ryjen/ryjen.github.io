And we indirectly like to think we are a part of something.</p><p>All the pandemic, racism, sexism, and inequality is hugely symptomatic of suffering and the mind run amok in resistance.</p><p>The double standards of duality, like a snake eating its own tail, both sides feeding their pain from the other.</p><h3 id=fire-to-end-suffering>Fire to end Suffering</h3><p>Nothing aggravates me more than hearing people talk of &ldquo;fighting&rdquo; pandemics or going to &ldquo;war&rdquo; on a particular situation.</p><p>This is how the mental-emotional virus spreads, reactive instead of skillful action (or maybe it is just mad-cow disease ðŸ˜†).</p><p>What you resist persists. Is that why these things don&rsquo;t alleviate?</p><p>I feel like a lot of problems (hint: trumpism) would disappear if you stopped giving them attention.</p><h3 id=self-immolation>Self Immolation</h3><p>Am reminded of the acts of <a href=https://tricycle.org/beginners/buddhism/why-have-some-buddhist-monks-set-themselves-on-fire/>self-immolation of monks of Vietnam</a>.</p><p>They believed by sacrificing themselves they would call attention to seek help.</p><div class=center><img src=/image/musings/self-immolation.jpg alt=self-immolation></div><br><p>It is somewhat questionable whether this is <a href=https://secularbuddhism.org/strong-views-and-skillful-action/>skillful action</a>.</p><p>Undoubtedly an act of compassion by not continuing against their aggressors. Just in the most extreme way.</p><p>Seems like a lot of people may feel this extreme inner turmoil. Questionable whether you can call reacting to this inner turmoil &ldquo;freedom&rdquo;.</p><p>With things like &ldquo;terrorism&rdquo; as an <strong>invisible line in the sand against insanity</strong>&mldr;.</p><p>Questionable whether it is getting addressed at all or whether it is getting more repressed and violent.</p><h3 id=upwards-and-onwards>Upwards and Onwards</h3><p>I wish I could wave a magic wand and alleviate all the worlds constant unnecessary problems&mldr;</p><p>Because they <strong>distract terribly</strong> from the real ones.</p><p>The real problems are coming if not already here and getting worse (environment, inequality, tech disruption, legacy infrastructure).</p><p>Perhaps Elon Musk will ship all the extroverts off into space to find what they were looking for externally.</p><p>That should solve it. But I think I will stay here.</p>
