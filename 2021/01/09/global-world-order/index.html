Same concept.</p><p>It becomes so apparent that a world governing organization is not only extremely risky in terms of power and difficult in terms of fairness, it is also undesirable given any current governments performance in the world.</p><p>The world organizations that exist today like the World Bank, International Monetary Fund or even United Nations just seem to be a next-level pat-on-the-back retreats for bureaucrats in love with the system that serves them.</p><p>Einstein said, <strong>&ldquo;You cannot fix a problem using the same consciousness that created it."</strong></p><p>Same problem with governments really, case in point with that god awful Trumpist in the Imperial Quartet.</p><h2 id=new-world-order>New World Order</h2><p>If there must be a New World Order, I like what is proposed by <a href=https://www.thevenusproject.com/>the Venus Project</a>.</p><p>They claim that the world should switch to a <a href=https://www.thevenusproject.com/resource-based-economy/>Resource Based Economy</a>.</p><p>A Resource based economy simply involves treating earth like it is a spaceship.</p><p>The monetary system stopped being backed by physical currency a long time ago and is ultimately &ldquo;fictional&rdquo;.</p><p>It is even &ldquo;stranger than fiction&rdquo; because it has real world consequences despite being mind-made. As such, is capable of wreaking havoc that any planetary being would not normally intend.</p><p>We have a limited number of resources on our Earth space ship and we must stop the bullshit, take stock of what we have left, allocate and plan accordingly.</p><p>Obviously, I am not sure how this would solve any drama with limited resources, and still requires governance, but maybe that is not the point.</p><p>In fact, my final opinion on the Venus Project is that the monetary world can still exist at a country level for the ego kids to play in and hopefully evolve out of.</p><p>I know how flaky it sounds, like environmentalists trying to avoid turning Earth into an uninhabitable Venus. But honestly, I don&rsquo;t see a more logical approach.</p><h2 id=taxing-countries>Taxing Countries</h2><p>We have already starting taxing countries that opt-in to environmental treaties, but they have not been very successful in my opinion because you have to balance the survival of the puppies and the families.</p><p>Lets take that hit tune or jab from the Imperial Trumpist Quartet called &ldquo;Tax/Sue China for Covid-19&rdquo;.</p><p>Pretty moronic for something unintentional, but it got me thinking about some of the things I would tax America for.</p><h3 id=the-petition-a-sample-flyer>The Petition: A Sample Flyer</h3><p>Do you live in a culture of Envy & Ego (the word ego is misunderstood and overused, but do not know how else to describe it).</p><p>Did you report your college sexual assault in a monotone voice? Were the confident Alpha-Beta boys not satisfied with pornography and have their way with you?</p><p>Did your religion get reduced to a bunch of TV infomercial fanatics, bigotry, dogmatism, chauvinism and frankly, insanity?</p><p>Are you tired of greed and inequality being protected by legalese?</p><p>Do you suffer existing in avoidance of all those great fucking cars and their infrastructure, even though you do so for safety of body and mind?</p><p>Do you feel deeply offended by the Imperial Trumpist Quartet&rsquo;s tune or their backlash such as #blm and #metoo? (Is a fish privileged if it only knows living in water?)</p><p>Are you tired of the good guy fight that keeps fucking you in the arse like a piece of shit because he is so much better than you?</p><p>Are you tired of feeling like you are alone in a connected world because people are too fucking brainwashed with a shit culture you cannot relate to them?</p><p>Are you tired of the mad cows and environment cost of eating hormone fueled, chemicalized sugar shit produced in mass cruelty and insanity just for the luxury of it?</p><p>Are you tired of being insane, following a path you did not choose, being treated like an idiot or you don&rsquo;t matter?</p><p>Did art and music get reduced to fucking irrelevant bullshit?</p><p>Are you tired of war, manipulation and over competition?</p><p>Are you tired of wasting time not dealing with real problems?</p><p>Are you tired of a cultural link in your own home but you have no vote? While being told to look at problems within yourself? Like living in a pseudo polygamous marriage with an asshole who says tough shit?</p><p>Are you tired of your good stuff being bought up and being thrown crap?</p><p><strong>Lets Tax America For It.</strong></p>
