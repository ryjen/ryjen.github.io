<div class=header><h1 class=title>Opinion Wall</h1><p class=subtitle>A list of opinions that I collect from the atmosphere.</p><aside class=subheader><div class=readinfo>ETA: 503 words, 3 minutes</div><div class=timestamps>Created: January 1, 2021</div></div></aside></div><ol><li><p>Opinions are also like onions. They can make others cry, or your &ldquo;self&rdquo; when it gets all wrapped in as who you are.</p></li><li><p>Given the atomic bomb of the &ldquo;pill&rdquo;, I think professional sex workers are less expensive than wives and with less drama. But I do not trust Pimps or the Porn industry to regulate health. I want Health Canada to step in.</p></li><li><p>#MeToo and Feminism has devolved into reverse chauvinism. Why change the game? They say. If men are pigs we will get revenge and be one too (by playing the not or not game).</p></li><li><p>Opinions are all people have in most cases. They form a fragile wall of self that protects and capitalizes. Like this one will inevitably become like everyone else.</p></li><li><p><a href=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/what-is-tantric-sex>Tantric Sex</a> is so much more appealing than kink and one-hour tricks and I could do it would anyone, any size, any age.</p></li><li><p>Aside from the immediate environmental dangers, I think the biggest challenge humanity will face is being to smart for our own good coupled with inequality.</p></li><li><p>The monetary system is like the matrix construct to me. For all its advantages, I long for Morpheus, Trinity and the white rabbit to show us (or me) another way. Society should take a long hard look at the one-size fits all path of a human life. It is literally like being cattle bred for the slaughter at the end, while being deluded with reward. It is happiness in purgatory, one step up from happiness in slavery. Maybe the aboriginal way of life could be available to all as a respite from the construct we cannot avoid.</p></li><li><p>After $50 million in assets, everything is taxable (adopted from step-father).</p></li><li><p>For all of a humans giant brain, animals and plants are more conscious and in-tune with the universe.</p></li><li><p>Throughout humanity very few humans show the levels of consciousness required to evolve as a species. Tao, Buddha, Jesus, Muhammad, Ghandi&mldr; perhaps others who remain unknown in fear of being a false idol.</p></li><li><p>Nanotechnology is going to shred playbook on existence. AI is a stepping stone to managing its complexity. Humans will be faced with a stark choice - evolve beyond our ego, or die. Attempting to control will increase the inequality divide. And trust me, you do not want that anymore.</p></li><li><p>Being a man in the modern world is kinda of a bad deal. You are torn apart by hypocrisy and double standards. You lack a right of passage to be a man. If you manage to stumble you way to being one, your tribe is emasculated by impossible expectations and repression.</p></li><li><p>Happiness has devolved into a means to end for success, business, survival and revenge. It is no longer acceptable to fail at happiness - an impossible feat in life. The true causes are also impossible to deal with, so drugs or die.</p></li><li><p>Confidence is a bully or rapist just the same as an unconfident person.</p></li><li><p>Turbans seem like the greatest thing ever for society. Must I change religion to wear one?</p></li></ol>
