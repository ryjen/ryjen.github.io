<div class=header><h1 class=title>Killing the Pain</h1><p class=subtitle>A shift in career and prototypical death rant</p><aside class=subheader><div class=readinfo>ETA: 463 words, 3 minutes</div><div class=timestamps>Created: January 5, 2021</div></div></aside></div><p>Pain is the only lens from which I can view the software industry.</p><p>&ldquo;Killing&rdquo; is such a sales word, but its what I want to do to it.</p><p>Normally, a level of unsatisfaction would be OK - its just a job. Hard to accept as a hobby once loved, or as a threatened means of survival.</p><p>People tell me I am too negative (which I am). Easy for them to say.</p><p>More easy to take advantage of happy people isn&rsquo;t it?</p><p>Easy to turn on people that get in the way happiness too, isn&rsquo;t it?</p><p>Everywhere I turn these days, in my mind I expect to be blocked and disappointed.</p><p>It adds a little bit more pain to a very large and growing body of pain. Like a virus.</p><hr><p>There are two planets, one of beings and one of apes, and the apes have it. And they are hairy.</p><p>I imagine monkeys from 2001 space odyssey finding a tool and sensing its power.</p><p>I imagine being like them and using a bone(r) to smash the head of every newbie nerd, ignorant superior, every slippery sales person, and every hypnotized capitalist pig wannabe American that ever threatened me.</p><p>There is something very satisfying imagining smashing until their head is nothing but a bloody stump that no longer disrespects my survival or love. It matters not if I am negative or jealous anymore.</p><p>All the while with glorious epic music cheering me on.</p><hr><p>One cannot work or do much of anything in this state of mind obviously.</p><p>Has been an increasing problem. When covid cut the thread I was hanging from&mldr;</p><p>I knew from the relief I felt, that there would probably be some sort of failed rebound, and an abused career would die. Just like my relationship and family expectations.</p><hr><p>Companies are in need of good people and want to weed out bad ones.</p><p>I hate it when companies try to make work like a family. There is nothing I like about a dysfunctional family - personal of work.</p><p>I usually end up on the losing end of the dysfunctional family stick. Always half pulling you out of the shit but not enough.</p><p>People often think recruiters are used for incoming, but I suspect they could be used for outgoing as well. &ldquo;Butter up&rdquo; a person into thinking they are quite something, and send in a recruiter.</p><hr><p>Thus, I do declare, I need some dignity, a career change and some help.</p><p>A bully can be confident or not, I find the need for happiness and confidence and being a winner all the time - weak.</p><p>To get away from the happy phonies, the abuse and not be contributing to someones ego, career, partner or family would be like HEAVEN.</p><p>Anything else would be poison.</p>
