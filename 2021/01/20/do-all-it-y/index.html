A very popular duality.</p><p>Why earth has evolved sexes for most life I don’t know.</p><p>Some say perhaps the competition and diversity helped evolution. A logical “thought” from Darwin though I question its efficiency (spray and pray? Really?)</p><p>Some say a creator must have made both (hmm).</p><p>The degree to which a self aware human identifies with its hetro-sexual identity - seems to increase the level of neediness for its opposite to complete it.</p><p>In other words, not whole. Only one half. Not holy whole.</p><p>And yet even non-hetro-sexual humans will long for another, which indicates to me that there is a link to something deeper than sexual completion, Darwinism or a creator.</p><p>Most people will not recognize their love as an addiction, a thought, an identity or a chemical in their brain.</p><p>Even if they do on some level, recognizing the ultimate reality and temporary-ness of it creates an almost inability to trust another person as “completion” or to trust your self.</p><p>Despite that, we are social creatures because our infants are completely helpless.</p><p>And I would wager that a certain amount of chemical delusion and sexual pleasure is required to face the extreme dangers of child birth and of child’s life.</p><p>We all exist because of either a mistake, or a delusion.</p><p>Going forward I will just call this delusion the “human reality”.</p><p>This human reality must persist at least enough for a youngling to adapt - like a reality bubble or egg.</p><p>Women tend to live more on the human reality side where as men will attempt to reconcile the human reality with the form based reality. Ultimately in failure.</p><p>Perhaps this is how our dangerously insane ego is developed as well.</p><p>Religion seems to do a great job at persisting this human reality into adulthood. As an answer for reconciling our vast consciousness with inevitability and impermanence.</p><p>And one can perhaps understand that is not immoral to do so - if it is better than undertaking the suffering from cracking the human reality egg.</p><p>Most people will suffer immensely without another. Potentially for a long time if there are social circumstances inhibiting it like health, trust, happiness, security, attention, lack of guidance, etc.</p><p>Such polarized suffering can create dysfunction along the way for themselves and others before being forced to rise above such neediness, remaining in distraction, succumbing to it and even worse - realizing it does not complete them at all.</p><p>The major shadow side of the human reality however is unsustainability imho.</p><p>We are in the midst of an infantile, unprecedented and unmitigated extension of the human reality through its economic system and technology only in the last century.</p><p>The success of the economic system as the new god of the human reality is probably because of how effective it is as manipulating the world of form from our bubble reality.
Which is comment since ancient civilizations - the difference now is technology is the fuel and the massive scale of our delusion is threatening the planet.</p><p>In its current state, the human reality unconsciously justifies or denies the consequences with its religion based attempts at reconciliation, its freedom and fight inevitability, and belief they are separate entities from the universe as an enemy.</p></div></div></section><footer id=footer class=legs><div class="has-text-centered content"><div class="is-flex is-align-items-center is-justify-content-center"><div class="has-text-centered m-3"><button id=themer class=themer type=button>enlighten</button></div><a href=https://github.com/ryjen/ryjen.github.io/issues/new>See an issue?</a></div><div class=copyright>© all rights reserved, ryan jennings</div></div></footer><script src=/js/vendor.min.js defer></script><script src=/js/theme.min.js defer></script><script src=/js/app.min.js defer></script><script data-goatcounter=https://analytics.micrantha.com/count async src=//analytics.micrantha.com/count.js></script></body></html>
