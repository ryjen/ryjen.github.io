      <description>A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack is a network security attack where a malicious device enters a network and intercepts traffic between nodes or components.
To accomplish access to a network an attacker needs an entry point.
There are many ways for a malicious device to accomplish access into a network.</description>

      <description>The Monatistic-Social-Techno pseudo reality Stranger than fiction.
Money is a fictional mind-made entity yet has tremendous real world consequences.
The social lives of humans are mostly fictional yet also have tremendous consequences.
The technology we create always has good intentions and negative consequences.</description>

      <description>The big trade off between Flutter and React is:
web support vs spread operator
Sound silly? Let me elaborate&amp;hellip;
flutter / dart The main advantage here is web support. With react the mobile and web components are not compatible without some experimental library to translate them.</description>

      <description>One of my favourite tools now is modd.
Why is it so great? It does one job, and it does it well, in proper unix fashion.
Monitoring a file-system and running a daemon that reloads if anything changes.
Also in proper Unix fashion, the daemon is sent a configurable SIGHUP when a file changes.</description>

      <description>Mindfulness.
When I first heard the word, my mind said &amp;ldquo;oh, the geniuses that may be have come up with more politically correct word&amp;hellip;. Just like breaking down diagnosis&amp;rsquo;s to something more friendly&amp;rdquo;.
Did not think much more about than that, same old, same old.</description>

      <description>I am so &amp;ldquo;hard done by&amp;rdquo; (adjective; used, cheated, dejected).
It is like a game of attention, who is the most hard done by?
The winner is also the biggest loser, because they are the most hard done by.
Don&amp;rsquo;t I get it yet?</description>

      <description>The dualistic nature of things, that appears so often on earth (look for them you will see)
Could be based on the polarizing energies of male and female that manifest across mammals and other species.

Always heard about others using the Dvorak keyboard layout and thought, &amp;ldquo;boy that is really neat, but too much work to change&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>After some discussions earlier today regarding legality, countries and the internet, had to jot down some thoughts.
The rule of law for governing works at different levels.
Am sure you are aware how globalization and the internet have exposed how difficult it is for countries to integrate with each other without some sort of super world organization governing that.</description>

Something really positive about covid-19&amp;hellip;
Is something that drives me wild with love 😍 and passion 😘

      <description>Context: American White House Takeover by Protesters (aka racist terrorists)
Do you ever notice that whenever humanity gets squeezed, our worst selves make the most noise?
The mental-emotional state of the human condition, acting like a virus. And we indirectly like to think we are a part of something.</description>

Are you more than a pin point in time?
If your body degenerates, are you still your body?
If your thought changes, are you still your thought?</description>

      <description>Pain is the only lens from which I can view the software industry.

  Given the atomic bomb of the &amp;ldquo;pill&amp;rdquo;, I think professional sex workers deserve some rights.</description>

      <description>Yes, rubber duck debugging is really funny (post it on quack overflow!).
The wiki, a dedicated site or coding horror explain it pretty well.
It is a fantastic methodology because there is no other human to try and take advantage of your stupidity - implicitly (unconsciously) or explicitly (capitalism).</description>

      <description>Winners and Losers. All of us have probably felt this is true in some level.
Its true with men, and the various games in the lives of the different hues of man.
Have not read Trumpian literature on the subject but do have my own opinion that is somewhat biased to the loser side.</description>

&amp;ldquo;Little bottle of hope&amp;rdquo; for saving humans and creating prosperity for more (groan, yes, more humans are needed now eh).

      <description>Politics. Does it matter? Why?
It is great that the human condition is suffering, as there is a plethora of issues to take unconscious action on.
When it comes down to actionable issues that are most common, it is always children.</description>

      <description>The wikipedia on art in the 21st century is hilariously lacking.
Curious how distracted it all feels, rebounding in trauma from the constant suffering and crises.

      <description>Well I spent some time put a web front end to some java code I made a long time ago for a MUD
The project is a decent example of Jersey, SocialAuth and WebSockets with some other nifty things (taken from other frameworks - like flash messages).</description>

      <description>Do you remember that game you played when you were young? The one where one person would say something, and it gets passed around until its a completely new story? Over the holidays, I came up with an idea for a web app that essentially does the same thing but in the context of creating a story.</description>

      <description>Found out that C structs can be casted between each other if the field types and ordering are the same. It is not portable code, but you can start too see how and why the virtual table and object oriented programming evolved in c++.</description>

      <guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/archive/crafting-a-game-with-craftyjs/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Briefly going to mention a javascript game engine called CraftyJS that I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with the past couple of days.
Has the usual suspects like Entity Component System, Collision, Sprite Maps, etc.
The Project 
Amos the Alien is a small demo I made.</description>

      <title>Found Bug in Apple Tool &#39;HeaderDoc&#39;</title>
      <link>https://ryanjennin.gs/archive/found-bug-in-apple-tool-headerdoc/</link>

      <guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/archive/found-bug-in-apple-tool-headerdoc/</guid>
      <description>HeaderDoc is a tool to generate source code documentation for many languages. Recently, I noticed that one of the command line tools &amp;lsquo;gatherheaderdoc&amp;rsquo; was producing a blank output file. Wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure why at first, but since its just a perl script I delved a little deeper to find the bug.</description>

      <description>Background I have it set up on my OSX machine to give me a random fortune when I log into the shell. I thought it would be a good idea to port this to Android in the form of a widget and Droid Fortunes was born!</description>

      <description>Introduction Thought I would share some tricks I use for easy data CRUD&amp;rsquo;s in C. I&amp;rsquo;m using Sqlite here, but could apply to any database.
Not saying its the best approach at all (nor ryjen/db), this is just how it evolved for me.</description>

      <title>Tired of Version Control Commit Messages?</title>

      <guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/posts/tired-of-version-control-commit-messages/</guid>
      <description>Ran across this absurd version control commit message generator message generator. Even has a plugin for the best code editor around Sublime Text 2. The api is a simple index.txt for scripting: ``python req = urllib2.Request(&amp;lsquo;http://whatthecommit.com/index.txt&#39;) res = urllib2.urlopen(req, timeout=5) message = res.</description>

      <guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/archive/merge-folders-applescript-service/</guid>
      <description>I recently tried to merge folders in OSX Lion using copy/paste in finder. To my surprise, the only action I could perform was to replace the folder.
I came up with a little AppleScript to create a Finder service for merging folders.</description>
