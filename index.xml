Do you think you mind or the situation generates more suffering?
That you deserve better? That you are overlooked?
That your perception of reality is absolute?
That you might physically die if you are not what you believe?
Do people take advantage of your suffering? Or challenge it?
Is your suffering physical, mental or both?
Do you think there is a &amp;ldquo;mind behind the mind&amp;rdquo; that sees with pureness (awareness)?</description></item><item><title>A tale of Belonging</title><link>https://ryanjennin.gs/2020/12/01/a-tale-of-belonging/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/2020/12/01/a-tale-of-belonging/</guid><description>To belong in the world
One must display a belief

Kindness and responsibility
Being the bringer of life.
To belong in this world
One must display
Total confidence

To belong in this world
One must display
A positive mind
And forgive your self when not.

All of us have probably felt this is true in some level.
Its true with men, and the various games in the lives of the different hues of man.
Have not read Trumpian literature on the subject but do have my own opinion that is somewhat biased to the loser side.
Starting with the most noisy:
Winners In the winner realm there are other dualities that signify their deserving of winning.</description></item><item><title>Covac</title><link>https://ryanjennin.gs/2020/11/09/covac/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/2020/11/09/covac/</guid><description>Am very glad a covid vaccine has a real chance.
&amp;ldquo;Little bottle of hope&amp;rdquo; for saving humans and creating prosperity for more.
That being said, I am actually very bitter going back to the new-normal, with a lot of skepticism.
Seed of the Lemon The root of my problem is that the new-normal is just the old-abnormal and that pre-covid life was not that great anyway.
We were always already living on the edge of collapse: environmental, economic, war, societal, or technological.</description></item><item><title>The Dreams</title><link>https://ryanjennin.gs/2020/10/31/the-dreams/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/2020/10/31/the-dreams/</guid><description>Life is a like a dream, a background awareness of reality.â€¦. as a nightmare at worst and a delusion at best. You can guide your self down the stream, but you do not know where you are going and you cannot go back.
Caught somewhere in between the trickle of survival, getting ahead, a social life, and a personal life - the dream of solid ground seems a myth.</description></item><item><title>Poly Techs</title><link>https://ryanjennin.gs/2020/10/18/poly-techs/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/2020/10/18/poly-techs/</guid><description>Politics. Does it matter? Why?
It is great that the human condition is suffering, as there is a plethora of issues to take unconscious action on.
When it comes down to actionable issues that are most common, it is always children.
Save the puppies first and foremost. It all kind of bubbles up to that.
Real change like saving the environment, technology, inequality, transcending the ego or peace always has an undesired effect that conflicts with the puppies.</description></item><item><title>Artist, Art tisk.</title><link>https://ryanjennin.gs/2020/10/10/artist-art-tisk./</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/2020/10/10/artist-art-tisk./</guid><description>The wikipedia on art in the 21st century is hilariously lacking.
Curious how distracted it all feels, rebounding in trauma from the constant suffering and crises.
There are some great artists who get overlooked compared to economics, disasters, in-equality or technology. The art itself is reflected by that merely resembles pornography or violence.
Art delivery has a digital / non-digital divide that correlates with the 21st century.
The first 20 years have been a digital revolution.</description></item><item><title>Indulgence into the past</title><link>https://ryanjennin.gs/2020/10/01/indulgence-into-the-past/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/2020/10/01/indulgence-into-the-past/</guid><description>Hello, World Trying to find at least zero motivation for the tech industry instead of negative infinity.

True schemaless databases came into my radar with MongoDB, Redis and such. I have often admired the ability to alter schema on fly and enjoyed experimenting with the possibilities.
Enterprise solutions like Couchbase and Firebase have been big successes (even the now defunct Cparse).
Why? The success of schemaless databases makes a lot of sense in part because of API consumption of JSON and mobile devices if you can get the synchronization part right.</description></item><item><title>Myths Fading, Direction of Evolution</title><link>https://ryanjennin.gs/2020/07/07/myths-fading-direction-of-evolution/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/2020/07/07/myths-fading-direction-of-evolution/</guid><description>Remembering a concept from the book Sapiens (paraphrasing):

A module of this tool is automatic versioning using semantic version.
The versioning The way I wanted the versioning to work is to have thresholds for when a version component auto-increments.
For example:
A patch version will increment after 300 builds A minor version will increment after 100 patch builds This use as a reminder to bump a version if there are breaking changes or if you need to do more design.</description></item><item><title>12 Bar Blues</title><link>https://ryanjennin.gs/2019/10/02/12-bar-blues/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/2019/10/02/12-bar-blues/</guid><description>You might have heard of the blues, made famous as a way to make a living in the US for marginalized citizens.

Jenkins or other continuous integration (CI) can automate this. This log is a brief summary of how in case I need to reproduce.

To do this, the job calls another job to mirror any source repository to any set of destination repositories.</description></item><item><title>A self hosting journey</title><link>https://ryanjennin.gs/2019/02/07/a-self-hosting-journey/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/2019/02/07/a-self-hosting-journey/</guid><description>Introduction Would like to say that I have valid privacy or security concerns.

cparse Another exercise in futility, a C implementation for the REST api at parse.com. Really the core of it is a web client and an object structure using json.
polymorphing I started off by having separate structure for the different type of objects, but I quickly realized there was a lot of code duplication. To solve this I used a combination of type defines and function pointers to the library API appear to be working with a seperate type, but are indeed still working with the base object type.</description></item><item><title>Elixir and Phoenix</title><link>https://ryanjennin.gs/2015/09/09/elixir-and-phoenix/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/2015/09/09/elixir-and-phoenix/</guid><description>Introduction If you dont know phoenix framework, I&amp;rsquo;d describe it as rails for elixir.

I&amp;rsquo;m using Sqlite here, but could apply to any database.
Not saying its the best approach at all (nor ryjen/db), this is just how it evolved for me.
Mapping The core of my data access is the FieldMap structure, which determines how to save each field to the database.
/* * this is the magical table used to communicate between memory and the database */ typedef struct FieldMap { const char *name; /* name of the field */ void *value; /* a pointer to the value of the field */ int type; /* type of value */ const void *arg1; /* additional argument */ const void *arg2; /* additional argument */ int flags; /* usage flags */ } FieldMap; /* callback for custom field types */ typedef int (*CustomField) (sqlite3_stmt *, int column, FieldMap *field); typedef void (*DbCallback) (sqlite3_stmt *); Basically you would have to:Example 1 - Saving This high level example shows building a quick table for each field we want to save in the database.</description></item><item><title>Best Programming Quotes</title><link>https://ryanjennin.gs/2012/04/10/best-programming-quotes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Apr 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/2012/04/10/best-programming-quotes/</guid><description>Quotes that relate to software engineering always humble me with their laser-like honesty.
