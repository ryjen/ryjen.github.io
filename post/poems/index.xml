      <description>I watch them beat you,
Watch them beat you down.
There is nothing I can do,
Brother, just like you.
So when things go wrong,
Go wrong with you,
It hurts me too.
 They say you know,
You know what to do.
It is so common,
So common its true.
Because things cant go wrong,
Go wrong with you,
It is so untrue.
 I watch them steal,
Your whole life away.</description>

      <description>Do you feel entitled to be a victim of someone or something else?
Do you think your mind or the situation generates more suffering?
Do you think that you deserve better? That you are overlooked?
That your perception of reality is absolute?
That you might physically die if you are not what you think?
Do people take advantage of your suffering? Or challenge it?
Is your suffering physical, mental or both?</description>
