      <description>A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack is a network security attack where a malicious device enters a network and intercepts traffic between nodes or components.
To accomplish access to a network an attacker needs an entry point.
There are many ways for a malicious device to accomplish access into a network.</description>

      <description>The big trade off between Flutter and React is:
web support vs spread operator
Sound silly? Let me elaborate&amp;hellip;
flutter / dart The main advantage here is web support. With react the mobile and web components are not compatible without some experimental library to translate them.</description>

      <description>One of my favourite tools now is modd.
Why is it so great? It does one job, and it does it well, in proper unix fashion.
Monitoring a file-system and running a daemon that reloads if anything changes.
Also in proper Unix fashion, the daemon is sent a configurable SIGHUP when a file changes.</description>

      <description>Decided to switch to using a alternate keyboard layout, not too long ago&amp;hellip;. Well I guess it has been a couple of years now. But I love it.
Always heard about others using the Dvorak keyboard layout and thought, &amp;ldquo;boy that is really neat, but too much work to change&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Yes, rubber duck debugging is really funny (post it on quack overflow!).
The wiki, a dedicated site or coding horror explain it pretty well.
It is a fantastic methodology because there is no other human to try and take advantage of your stupidity - implicitly (unconsciously) or explicitly (capitalism).</description>

      <description>TL;DR - Hydrid relational schemaless databases are quite awesome, with a little bit flowers in the garden.
True schemaless databases came into my radar with MongoDB, Redis and such. I have often admired the ability to alter schema on fly and enjoyed experimenting with the possibilities.</description>

      <description>Have become a fan boy of golang as a replacement for my beloved C purely because it is so simplified, and thus a guru language to me.

Couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but notice that all the API&amp;rsquo;s implement something called OpenAPI (&amp;quot;Swagger&amp;quot;) 2.0. Ok, great, consistency in API specs, that will help if you had to write one.</description>

If you don&amp;rsquo;t know erlang it has been around a while (open-sourced in 1998) and the virtual machine is designed to be highly fault tolerant and scalable for use in telecoms, banking and instant messaging (WhatsApp).</description>
