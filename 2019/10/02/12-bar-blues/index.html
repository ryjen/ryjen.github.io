Each bar consists of <strong>4 beats</strong> of <strong>quarter notes (♩ = 1/4)</strong>. It can be vocalized simply as <code>one, two, three, four</code>.</p><p>A time signature of <strong>5/8</strong> would mean <strong>5 beats</strong> of <strong>eighth notes (♪ = 1/8)</strong>. It can be vocalized as <code>one and two and three and four and five</code>.</p><h2 id=12-bar-blues-chords>12 bar blues: Chords</h2><p>The chords used in the 12 bar blues are the <strong>root</strong>, <strong>fourth</strong> and <strong>fifth</strong> (I · IV · V).</p><p>Using these basic melodic notes we can create a rhythm pattern for any key.</p><p>In key of <strong>C</strong> from the example on scales, the notes used would be: <strong>C</strong> · <strong>F</strong> · <strong>G</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>chord progression</strong> starts out simple and progressively gets more complicated before repeating.</p><h2 id=12-bar-blues-rhythm-and-changes>12 bar blues: Rhythm and Changes</h2><p>As a intro, the 12 bar blues rhythm formula looks like</p><p><code>4 · 2 · 2 · 1 · 1 · 1 · 1</code></p><p>It is in terms of <strong>bars per chord progression</strong> (4 bars of a chord followed by two bars of another and so on). The total of these values is <strong>12</strong> hence the title <strong>12 bar blues</strong></p><p>If we apply the roman numerals <strong>I · IV · V</strong> from the 12 bar chords to this pattern it looks more like:</p><p><code>I I I I · IV IV · I I · V · IV · I · V</code></p><p>Which is four bars of the first, two bars of the fourth, and so on.</p><p>You might also find it interesting to see a pattern with <strong>4</strong> and its sums: <code>4 = 2 + 2 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1</code></p><h2 id=bringing-it-on-home->Bringing it on home 🎸</h2><p>Applying note values to the previous pattern in the key of <strong>C</strong>, the 12 bar blues now looks like:</p><p><code>C C C C · F F · C C · G · F · C · G</code></p><p>To break that down:</p><ol><li>four bars of C (I)</li><li>two bars of F (IV)</li><li>two bars of C (I)</li><li>one bar of G (V)</li><li>one bar of F (IV)</li><li>one bar of C (I)</li><li>one bar of G (V) - also called the &lsquo;turnaround&rsquo; back to the beginning.</li></ol><p>Oh, how convenient, that is also <strong>7 key changes</strong>, just like the number of notes in a scale. <strong>Lucky 7</strong> I guess.</p><h2 id=practising-and-next>Practising and Next</h2><p>Get a feel for the notes, and use a metronome to count the rhythm per bar as you play them. Most people will play using the minor pentonic scale (I · flat III · IV · V · flat VII).</p><p><strong>Jazz Blues</strong> is a variation that I will leave to another post. Not quite sure which came first, but I would wager it would be a predecessor to the 12 bar blues.</p><p>There is also a lot of other things you can do to add flavor to the blues.</p><ul><li>&lsquo;Walking&rsquo; the notes in the scale</li><li>lead in/lead out notes</li><li>&lsquo;turnaround&rsquo; riffs</li><li>rhythm changes</li><li>pattern variations</li><li>solo in different modes (dorian is nice)</li></ul>
