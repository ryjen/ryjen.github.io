<div class=column>
<p>
Ryan's initial attempts in software came after high school with an interest in online games, and being able to
deduce how C code produced the features he knew, and develop new ones.</p>
<p>He spent a good 5 years working with remote internet citizens providing hosting and/or programming advice.
</p>
<p>Deciding it was a good career choice, Ryan explored continued education opportunities and achieved 2 Applied
Technology Certificates from BCIT in Software Development and Information Systems.</p>

<h1 class="title is-size-4">Early Career</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle is-size-5 mt-5">2007-2011</h2>
</div>
<div class=column>
<p>
After achieving certification, Ryan began looking for some work in the field in quality assurance.
Through a connection with one of his instructors and a manager from silicon valley, he landed a job testing
embedded systems at the ripe age of 29.
</p>
<p>He was successful in providing a comprehensive test plan that covered black box, virtual testing, network,
and
GPS
testing. As he was taking courses in C#, he was also offered a role in developing a configuration application
for
PALM mobile. This application communicated over ZigBee wireless module to a controller.</p>
<p>Continuing withe C# and mobile experience, Ryan then landed a contract to port PALM applications to Windows
Phone
and iOS using a cross platform framework. He continued to upgrade his education and got Certified in
Java from Oracle.</p>

<h1 class="title is-size-4">Intermediate Career</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle is-size-5 mt-5">20011-2015</h2>
</div>
<div class=column>
<p>Through a connection from his previous contract, Ryan was able to land a role at a fast-growing startup
developing
mobile applications for conferences. Working in Java Mobile Edition, Ryan was able to perform well with
backend,
quality, and management teams delivering customized framework applications for clients. He went above and
beyond
developing missing framework features consistent with other platforms. His strong programming
skills
allowed him to become a part of the product team formalizing the conference framework.</p>
<p>Ryan had trouble adjusting to the role of a leader in an environment that becoming increasingly corporate,
especially while continuing to upgrade his education part-time. He decided it would be better to step back and
join a smaller, more local startup with more creative freedom.</p>
<p>Ryan continued to expand his experience developing backend APIs, creating mobile applications from scratch,
and automated
testing while being able to walk to work. He helped other employees get involved in test automation and
assumed lead on mobile development.</p>
<p>Ryan also achieved the next step in education a full technical Certificate in Computer
Systems.
</p>
<p>The creativity of a startup were creative and enjoyable, however Ryan was begining to feel stress in his
personal and education life that contributed to a sense of disatisfaction.</p>

<div class=column>
<p>When offered a role with a Linux company specializing in
IT
services, telecoms and open-source, he decided to accept, programming for patented solutions.</p>
<p>During this transitionary time, a lead from his former employer had an offer with a more familiar business
model. Ryan continued to maintain enterprise client applications in
Android and upgrading.</p>
<p>In 2016, Ryan also decided to register a business name to put
his extracurricular project time into.</p>
<p>In
2018, after a successful acquisition from a large company, Ryan saw his role change to a
remote
team on iOS in addition to React Native.</p>
<p>
In 2020, due to COVID shutting down travel to conferences, Ryan became a
free-agent
again. He took the time to stay safe and finish his Diploma in Computer Systems along with certification in
AWS and Fullstack Development.</p>
