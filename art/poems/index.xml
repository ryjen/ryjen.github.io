Expecting a sense of urgency
Reinforcing weaknesses
With opposite strengths
Wanting their tit for a tat
Sharing the pain
For a missing floor
And make believe ceiling
I see a joy division
Avoiding damages done</description></item><item><title>When Things Go Wrong</title><link>https://ryanjennin.gs/art/poems/when-things-go-wrong/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/art/poems/when-things-go-wrong/</guid><description>I watch them beat you,
Watch them beat you down.
There is nothing I can do,
Brother, just like you.
So when things go wrong,
Go wrong with you,
It hurts me too.
They say you know,
You know what to do.</description></item></channel></rss>
