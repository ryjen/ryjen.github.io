      <description>I really liked the way Gobo Linux refactored the organization of a linux filesystem.
The short story of Gobo was to have each Recipe (application/library) install everything it needs into its own directory. The app files are then linked to support the legacy filesystem that the OS needs (You can read more at Gobo at Glance or the history of gobo linux).
Sound familiar? It&amp;rsquo;s very much like Homebrew which installs each Formula in a Cellar with links to /usr/local.</description>
