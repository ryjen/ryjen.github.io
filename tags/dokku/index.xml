Introduction Have always enjoyed the UNIX fortunes program, ever since I was a wee newbie. If you aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with it (sad), yes, its like a fortune cookie.
It can be more technical in nature but not always. It also has poems, quotations, and if enabled - offensive content.
Often I would find a fortune I&amp;rsquo;d like to share and pipe it to a snippet from the terminal.</description></item><item><title>Hugo + Dokku + Wercker = Goodness</title><link>https://ryanjennin.gs/archive/hugo-dokku-wercker-goodness/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/archive/hugo-dokku-wercker-goodness/</guid><description>Hugo Hugo is a static site generator with many powerful features like archtypes, themes, customization, etc.
Combined with tools like bower and brunch it makes for a pretty powerful app that could be more than a blog.
The workflow is simple - build your assets with brunch, run the hugo generator. The end result is a complete static html site you can deploy.
