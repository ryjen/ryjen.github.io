&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Skating is the funnest thing ever&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hockey positioning and physics is an art&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adult safe beer leagues and training leagues are great&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Youtube is a great supplementary coach&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Culture could be better&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you learned as a child, you have an advantage&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="skating-is-fun">Skating is fun&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There is nothing more freeing than whipping around the ice with power,
grace and efficiency. Has become more efficient since I was kid.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
