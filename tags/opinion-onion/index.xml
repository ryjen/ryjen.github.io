&lt;p>When I first heard the word, my mind said &amp;ldquo;oh, the geniuses that may be have come up with more politically correct word&amp;hellip;. Just like breaking down diagnosis&amp;rsquo;s to something more friendly&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Did not think much more about than that, same old, same old.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Global World Order</title><link>https://ryanjennin.gs/2021/01/09/global-world-order/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/2021/01/09/global-world-order/</guid><description>&lt;p>After some discussions earlier today regarding legality, countries and the internet, had to jot down some thoughts.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Am sure you are aware how globalization and the internet have exposed how difficult it is for countries to integrate with each other without some sort of super world organization governing that.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Opinion Wall</title><link>https://ryanjennin.gs/2021/01/01/opinion-wall/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/2021/01/01/opinion-wall/</guid><description>&lt;ol>

&lt;p>Given the atomic bomb of the &amp;ldquo;pill&amp;rdquo;, I think professional sex workers deserve some rights. Its not that I want to use their service, but it just does not make sense to control peoples bodies when we send people to war. What we do need to control is health. I do not trust, Dating Apps, Pimps or the Porn industry to regulate health. I would rather Health Canada to step in for safety and cleanliness.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mornin 'Mericas.</title><link>https://ryanjennin.gs/2020/11/21/mornin-mericas./</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ryanjennin.gs/2020/11/21/mornin-mericas./</guid><description>&lt;p>Winners and Losers. All of us have probably felt this is true in some level.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I am a late bloomer, not finding post-secondary until ~28 years of age.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have survived in catch-up mode for the last ~12 years, but ultimately has left me with many short straws, and no long ones. In my career, education and personal life.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
