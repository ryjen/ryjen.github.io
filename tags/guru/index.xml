      <description>Yes, rubber duck debugging is really funny (post it on quack overflow!).

      <description>Have become a fan boy of golang as a replacement for my beloved C purely because it is so simplified, and thus a guru language to me.
As it stands now, I am somewhat burned out in the depths of a mid-life crisis and pandemic.</description>
