      <description>Remembering a concept from the book Sapiens (paraphrasing):
 Ape hierarchy only existed in small groups with a limit (150 or so) with a dominant leader (alpha). This applies to humans as well, but we were able so surpass the threshold with myths and better communication.
 And the definition of ego by ET ðŸ‘½:
 A complete and total identification with form as who you are - a thought form or a physical form.</description>

      <description>Major Lessons Eckhart Tolle or ET is a unique individual, author and orator. After a suicidal night where he thought &amp;ldquo;I cannot live with myself any longer&amp;rdquo; and recognized the oddity of thought, as if there were two people &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;myself&amp;rdquo;. That recognition brought a radical inner transformation and years of intense bliss. He later learned more about what happened to him and became a &amp;ldquo;spiritual teacher&amp;rdquo;.
His books The Power of Now and A New Earth have been #1 on the New York Times best seller list.</description>
