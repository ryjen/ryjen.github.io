      <description>The wikipedia on art in the 21st century is hilariously lacking.
Curious how distracted it all feels, rebounding in trauma from the constant suffering and crises.
There are some great artists who get overlooked compared to economics, disasters, in-equality or technology.</description>

      <description>Love Poem Love is at the mercy of form,
Without, may as not be real.
Form is merciless,
At its peak and as it degrades.  Love is a chemical delusion,
That is dependent on others,
To keep the chemicals flowing.</description>
