      <description>The wikipedia on art in the 21st century is hilariously lacking.
Curious how distracted it all feels, rebounding in trauma from the constant suffering and crises.
There are some great artists who get overlooked compared to economics, disasters, in-equality or technology. The art itself is reflected by that merely resembles pornography or violence.
Art delivery has a digital / non-digital divide that correlates with the 21st century.
The first 20 years have been a digital revolution.</description>

      <description>Love Poem Love is at the mercy of form,
Without, may as not be real.
Form is merciless,
At its peak and as it degrades.  Love is a chemical delusion,
That is dependent on others,
To keep the chemicals flowing.  Love is loyalty and trust,
Devotion and passion.
Skewed by lack,
And absenteeism in,
A complex world.  Love is a great tree,
Of family and positivity,</description>
