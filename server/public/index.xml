      <description>Major Lessons  Eckhart Tolle or ET is a unique individual, author and orator. After a suicidal night where he thought &amp;ldquo;I cannot live with myself any longer&amp;rdquo; and recognized the oddity of thought, as if there were two people &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;myself&amp;rdquo;. That recognition brought a radical inner transformation and years of intense bliss. He later learned more about what happened to him and became a &amp;ldquo;spiritual teacher&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Introduction A log to myself of things I like about Unix type systems. In case I forget why someday.
Dotfiles files in braille? are they for the blind?
Dotfiles in Linux are hidden files preceded with a period. Depending on the program, they are used for configuration in your home directory.
It is common to have a set of dotfiles that you use regularly on different computer systems.
There are many ways and tools to manage your dotfiles.</description>

      <description>Introduction Debugging network traffic for your app can be useful, and sometimes necessary if the data is not what is expected or inconsistent.
The Proxy I prefer the open source proxy mitmproxy. Easy to install on OSX with homebrew.
brew install mitmproxy
I&amp;rsquo;ll leave it up to you to explore its greatness, I just wanna clarify the android setup.
Steps 1) mitmproxy Choose a port (ex. 8888) and start the program: mitmproxy -p 8888:</description>

      <description>Prerequisites You&amp;rsquo;ll need to prepare a bit.
 A local path on the server to store registry data. For example: /mydir/registry Docker installed on the client and server machine Dokku installed on the server  For Authentication  httpasswd command is installed  For an External Registry  Dokku letsencrypt plugin installed A working domain name pointing to the dokku app. For example, https://registry.mydomain.com  Create the dokku app Create the dokku app and retag a pre-existing repository image to it.</description>

      <description>view the service homepage
Introduction Have always enjoyed the UNIX fortunes program, ever since I was a wee newbie. If you aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with it (sad), yes, its like a fortune cookie.
It can be more technical in nature but not always. It also has poems, quotations, and if enabled - offensive content.
Often I would find a fortune I&amp;rsquo;d like to share and pipe it to a snippet from the terminal.</description>

      <description>Gonna evangelize a little bit.
When Microsoft bought Xamarin, they did not underestimate the power of Xamarin.Forms for building cross platform UIs. Now with the release of Visual Studio for macOS and the Dotnet Core, its looks like its going to stay alive.

      <title>Elixir and Phoenix</title>

      <description>Introduction 
If you dont know phoenix framework, I&amp;rsquo;d describe it as rails for elixir. If you dont know Elixir I&amp;rsquo;d describe it as a functional language that feels like ruby for erlang.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t know erlang it has been around a while (open-sourced in 1998) and the virtual machine is designed to be highly fault tolerant and scalable for use in telecoms, banking and instant messaging (WhatsApp).</description>

      <description>Like c++ without a virtual table, C structs can be casted between each other if the field types and ordering are the same. This is entirely not portable across systems.
A Quick Example struct Animal { int eyes; } struct Dog { int eyes; /* dog specific */ int tail; } struct Human{ int eyes; /* human specific */ int brain; }  We can pass humans or dogs to any function that takes an animal.</description>

      <title>Crafting a Game With CraftyJS</title>

      <guid>https://nullstruct.com/2012/11/17/crafting-a-game-with-craftyjs/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Briefly going to mention a javascript game engine called CraftyJS that I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with the past couple of days.
Has the usual suspects like Entity Component System, Collision, Sprite Maps, etc.
The Project 
Amos the Alien is a small demo I made.
I knew that I wanted a scrolling background of some sort - in other words - parallax scrolling. I also knew that I wanted two modes of scrolling: A) automatic background scrollin (clouds, etc) and character movement scrolling.</description>

      <title>C Sqlite Tricks</title>
      <link>https://nullstruct.com/2012/05/15/c-sqlite-tricks/</link>

      <guid>https://nullstruct.com/2012/05/15/c-sqlite-tricks/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Thought I would share some tricks I use for easy data CRUD&amp;rsquo;s in C. I&amp;rsquo;m using Sqlite here, but could apply to any database.
Not saying its the best approach at all (nor ryjen/db), this is just how it evolved for me.
Mapping The core of my data access is the FieldMap structure, which determines how to save each field to the database.
/* * this is the magical table used to communicate between memory and the database */ typedef struct FieldMap { const char *name; /* name of the field */ void *value; /* a pointer to the value of the field */ int type; /* type of value */ const void *arg1; /* additional argument */ const void *arg2; /* additional argument */ int flags; /* usage flags */ } FieldMap; /* callback for custom field types */ typedef int (*CustomField) (sqlite3_stmt *, int column, FieldMap *field); typedef void (*DbCallback) (sqlite3_stmt *);  Note: these examples will create this table dynamically with an object, however this can be used as a static table.</description>

      <description>Quotes that relate to software engineering always humble me with their laser-like honesty. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to keep a collection of my favorites here (in no particular order).
&#34;The only real education is self-education&#34; - Aristotle If I&#39;d known computer science was going to be like this, I&#39;d never have given up being a rock &amp;lsquo;n&#39; roll star. &amp;ndash; G.
