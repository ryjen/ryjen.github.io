      <description>Major Lessons  Eckhart Tolle or ET is a unique individual, author and orator. After a suicidal night where he thought &amp;ldquo;I cannot live with myself any longer&amp;rdquo; and recognized the oddity of thought, as if there were two people &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;myself&amp;rdquo;. That recognition brought a radical inner transformation and years of intense bliss. He later learned more about what happened to him and became a &amp;ldquo;spiritual teacher&amp;rdquo;.</description>
