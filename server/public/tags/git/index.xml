      <description>Introduction For some software development projects, there may be a need to backup or mirror the repository to a different location.
Jenkins or other continuous integration (CI) can automate this. This log is a brief summary of how in case I need to reproduce.
Workflow The requirement is to have a single jenkins job that synchronizes various other projects and repositories.
To do this, the job calls another job to mirror any source repository to any set of destination repositories.</description>

Introduction Have always enjoyed the UNIX fortunes program, ever since I was a wee newbie. If you aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with it (sad), yes, its like a fortune cookie.
It can be more technical in nature but not always. It also has poems, quotations, and if enabled - offensive content.
Often I would find a fortune I&amp;rsquo;d like to share and pipe it to a snippet from the terminal.</description>
