<h1 class="title">Indulgence into the past</h1>
</header>
<h2 id="hello-world">Hello, World</h2>
<p>Trying to find at least zero motivation for the tech industry instead of negative infinity.</p>
<p>I do not normally focus too much on the past, but it might be worth investigating for a source redemption from the conditions that negate me.</p>
<h2 id="s">80’s</h2>
<p>Family had a <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/2tfgqmqPSdWz53RZ9">Mac Classic</a> in the 80’s</p>
<p>Pretty forward thinking to name your “new” product “classic”.</p>
<p>The baby boomers loved it, and so did I.</p>
<p>Paint, and <a href="https://youtu.be/QIxGW4Ns1UI">missile command</a>.</p>
<p>Primitive but just as good as my old Atari.</p>
<h2 id="s-1">90’s</h2>
<p>The dark ages in the 90’s I spent most of time (too much) in some sort of remote *nix shell thanks to a friendly Alaskan bear.</p>
<p>We worked on a game that had some users, I learned a ton, and even experienced my first coder burnout.</p>
<p>(Burnout is an accumulation of tech problems and real-life problems. Have never seen one without the other).</p>
<p>Still had an older mac II type thing but mostly switched to Windows.</p>
<h2 id="millennium">Millennium</h2>
<p>Finally clued in that I should get higher ed, thanks to yet another helpful stranger.</p>
<p>Revelation came with OSX and a pseudo *nix layer. Joygasm!</p>
<p>A wonderful period of renaissance for all! Can score a job!</p>
<p>Internet of phones! (TCP!)</p>
<h2 id="current">Current</h2>
<p>Now the Apple has been bit.</p>
<p>My ed was disappointing, and the jobs were too.</p>
<p>The stratosphere of ego is extra ordinary (and more intolerant).</p>
<p>I find my self longing for the underground again.</p>
<p>Going back to linux and C, it</p>
<p>is another sign of apple dark ages for me.</p>
<p>Has always been there for me.</p>
<h2 id="future-reflection">Future, Reflection</h2>
<p>Gophers to me are the meek, that will inherit the earth, when the ego dinosaurs, money monkeys, and wannabe’s become extinct.</p>
<p>I cannot really see myself enjoying the industry or its people again.</p>
<p>But maybe thats why its called “Work”, but its like the alien in American Dad, where not allowed to be a jerk is like poison.</p>
<p>A dream scenario would be something like a “lighthouse maintainer” on a remote island somewhere with satalite.</p>
<p>Where I can piddle away on side stuff in “off time” as needed and retire on a gov pension.</p>
