Not in my opinion, because human life was never normal. It is completely out of sync with the nature.</p><p>The only thing normal will be: <em>moving on to the next self-made, human-made, mind-made problem</em>.</p><h2 id=technological>Technological</h2><p>Does the fact the vaccine uses <em>nano-tech</em> bother anyone?</p><p>How is its use justified without a pandemic?</p><p>What if it creates a super-super bug?</p><p>Nanotechnology is still a technology we know nothing about in the <em>human body</em>.</p><p>The general public seems to be ignorant to the shadows of new technology in the face of their immediate needs.</p><h3 id=going-forward>Going Forward</h3><p>Nano technology has greater potential to destroy than the atomic bomb, yet greater potential for the benefits of humanity than the digital revolution.</p><p>A full-fledged <em>nano-society</em> will polarize the heaven and hell duality or inequality even more.</p><p>This is why evolving as a species beyond <strong>ego</strong> is so important, so we do not suffer and kill each other trying to alleviate it.</p><h2 id=environment--population>Environment / Population</h2><p>Does global population bother any of the <em>hypnotised unconscious problematic humans</em>, such as my &ldquo;self&rdquo;?</p><p>Does the vaccine have an effect on the environment? What scenarios would play out to mitigate any?</p><p>How much will it cost? Does it have inequality implications?</p><h2 id=politics>Politics</h2><p>Does the political timing of the vaccine bother anyone?</p><p>Perhaps it was released now in a <em>democratic US</em> as more <em>favourable</em> to its potential negative and positive outcomes.</p><p>Does anyone wonder why its a Canadian company developing the nano-tech? Or why the US does not have nano technology to do it themselves?</p><p>Perhaps a strategic advantage to maintain <em>unity</em> in the US upon possible negative outcomes.</p><p>Well, Canadians have opened Pandora&rsquo;s box on nano-tech into mainstream.</p><p>And the competition to enable the US to produce more.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><ul><li>Nano-tech is not to be taken lightly at all.</li><li>I still don&rsquo;t trust the US, corporations, or any other collective ego driven by profit.</li><li>Normal life sucks whether its new-normal, new-new-normal or just abnormal.</li><li>Pandemics, super bugs, global population and un-sustainability will continue.</li></ul>
