All of us have probably felt this is true in some level.</p><p>Its true with men, and the various games in the lives of the different hues of man.</p><p>Have not read Trumpian literature on the subject but do have my own opinion that is somewhat biased to the loser side.</p><p>Starting with the most noisy:</p><h2 id=winners>Winners</h2><p>In the winner realm there are other dualities that signify their deserving of winning.</p><p>Good and evil - winners are good, and people trying to take winning from them are evil.</p><p>Winners bring the light to the loser darkness.</p><p>In a human being, winners are the human.</p><p>The winner weapon of choice in the duality wars is positivity.</p><p>Positivity masks reality and their own natural human condition.</p><p>Winners dump negativity in the loser realm if they cannot vanquish it.</p><p>They are incapable of recognizing their own suffering as not external, through the positivity mask (or chemicals).</p><h2 id=losers>Losers</h2><p>In the loser realm the winners represent an extremist form of suffering.</p><p>In a human being, losers are the being (not taking a hue of man).</p><p>The attachment to positivity in the mother complex can delay enlightenment from the winner realm. Sometimes for an entire lifetime.</p><p>An unenlightened loser has other dualities to signify their victim hood. Such as unconscious vs conscious, suffering vs enlightenment, oppression vs liberation.</p><p>A semi-enlightened loser knows that the belief of light in the winner realm creates shadow - but is still more comfortable inside it.</p><p>An enlightened loser knows that there is ultimately no winner loser duality, but are forced to participate.</p><h2 id=insights>Insights</h2><p>The next-gen of America in the power transfer will be to a loser a next-gen of things to miss out on.</p><p>America is black and has soul. We will be missing out on that to which they are happy to export, which is fine, except I got bigger problems.</p><p>I walk amongst the winning zombies in loserville, all selling me something I am missing out on. Selling me America. Selling me false hope, or hope with a loss, hope on something to miss out on.</p><p>I see the drug overdoses and the poverty and I look at the history of heroin. How the British capitalized on China with heroin and think &ldquo;Yah, If I was asian or south asian, I would want heroin revenge for the British Columbia&rdquo;</p><p>I look at the pandemic struggles and how the winners suffer and how the losers enjoy it and my socialist tendencies think &ldquo;Yah, that is correct.&rdquo;</p><p>I look at social lives of others and see that everyone is trying extremely hard to be a winner to get revenge. Or being so distraught by people who&rsquo;s circumstances are just right to fit the cookie-cutter. Or following a pattern that makes them as stupid as possible and giving up as much data as possible.</p><p>I look at the winners seeping into the internet and the tech bubble in my lifetime and think &ldquo;well, that was a waste&rdquo;.</p><p>My old victimage says to me, Canada is a loser, America is a winner, and nobody is waking up from any of it.</p><p>At the end of the day, we are just the &lsquo;Mericas and I have no idea who Mexico is or why countries still exist in a inter-connected planet that is dying from such collective competition.</p></div></div></section><footer id=footer class=legs><div class="has-text-centered content"><div class="is-flex is-align-items-center is-justify-content-center"><div class="has-text-centered m-3"><button id=themer class=themer type=button>enlighten</button></div><a href=https://github.com/ryjen/ryjen.github.io/issues/new>See an issue?</a></div><div class=copyright>Â© all rights reserved, ryan jennings</div></div></footer><script src=/js/vendor.min.js defer></script><script src=/js/theme.min.js defer></script><script src=/js/app.min.js defer></script><script data-goatcounter=https://analytics.micrantha.com/count async src=//analytics.micrantha.com/count.js></script></body></html>
