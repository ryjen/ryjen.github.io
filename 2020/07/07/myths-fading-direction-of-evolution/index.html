This applies to humans as well, but we were able so surpass the threshold with myths and better communication.</p></blockquote><p>And the definition of ego by <a href=https://eckharttolle.com/>ET</a> ðŸ‘½:</p><blockquote><p>A complete and total identification with form as who you are - a thought form or a physical form.</p></blockquote><h3 id=observe>Observe</h3><p>It is apparent that <strong>human communication</strong> keeps <strong>improving on a logarithmic scale</strong>, starting with cave drawings, language, writing, phone, tv, internet, etc.</p><p>In the last century to today we have seen communication grow with technology.</p><p>Artificial intelligence and 5g seem to promise faster and more consumable data for communication</p><h3 id=combining>Combining</h3><p>The <strong>strength of the ego</strong> and other collective myths that enabled us to <strong>survive without much communication</strong>, is ironically somewhat <strong>diminished with more of it</strong>.</p><p>The more interconnected we become the more we cannot ignore <strong>previously unseen problems</strong> or rely on <strong>physical borders to keep out change</strong>.</p><p>Most of the <strong>dysfunction</strong> we see happening today is the <strong>unconscious reaction</strong> to strengthen the diminishing ego (we know not what we do!).</p><p>We have been a witness to the horrors of multiple global wars in just the latest century.</p><h3 id=result>Result</h3><p>The <strong>choices in evolution</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>continue to strengthen the egoic collectives and myths</p></li><li><p>recognize it, and as not who we are or unnecessary</p></li></ul><p>It is getting better (ego diminishing) and worse (reaction) at the same time, as ðŸ‘½ puts it.</p><p>Institutions and countries seem to either:</p><ul><li><p>transfer the ownership to its people in avoidance, who are no different so same problem and more justification of the collective as self.</p></li><li><p>rule with a heavy hand and attempt to manage ownership themselves, so same problem and more of a split that justifies a heavy hand.</p></li></ul><h3 id=outro>Outro</h3><p>We are on a tight rope in a circus of humanity. A balancing act trying not to annihilate ourselves.</p><p>The next evolution in human communication may be more disruptive than AI or 5g with nanotechnology.</p><p>My personal opinion is that continuing to try and strengthen fragile cathedral like myths and institutions is dangerous and futile. Serving only personal or collective identities.</p><p>Apple&rsquo;s 2014 slogan &ldquo;You are more powerful than you think&rdquo; is an interesting one.</p><p>It starts with your self, the micro-universe. A less sociopathic self is conducive to a less insane macro-universe. The goal being to be less at the mercy of form to define who you are and your state of consciousness. The less the need of form, the less dysfunction.</p><p>Earth deserves better for keeping us, evolve!</p>
